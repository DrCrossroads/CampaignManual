### **Tactics & Flavor**

- The **Warped Spawn thrives in dark alleyways, abandoned churches, or places where reality is thin**.
- It is **not fully formed**, a fragment of **something far worse**.
- When it dies, **its body collapses into a pool of shifting black sludge** that evaporates into mist.
- **Encounters:**
    - It might be a **failed experiment**, an **unfortunate victim of an eldritch ritual**, or **a piece of something larger trying to break through into the city**.
    - Some **mad cultists** may **worship it**, believing it to be an emissary of their god.
    - It **could be growing**—if left unchecked, it may **evolve into something much, much worse**.
