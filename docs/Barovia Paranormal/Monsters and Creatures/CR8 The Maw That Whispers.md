### **Traits**

**Whispers of the Abyss.** Creatures within **30 feet** of The Maw hear constant whispering voices in an alien tongue.

**Unstable Form.** The Maw **shifts and writhes**, making it difficult to strike. **Attack rolls against it have disadvantage** unless the attacker has truesight or magical blindsight.

**Abyssal Consumption.** When The Maw **reduces a creature to 0 HP**, it **devours part of their essence**, regaining **20 HP**. If it kills a creature, it gains **advantage on its next attack roll and saving throw**.
