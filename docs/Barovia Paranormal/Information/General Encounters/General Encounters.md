## Steps for General Encounters

### **Step 1: Determine Encounter Type (Roll 1d20)**

| **d20 Roll** | **Encounter Type**     |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1–9          | Crime Family Encounter |
| 10–16        | Cultist Encounter      |
| 17–20        | Special Encounter      |

| d4 Roll | Special Encounter                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Eldritch Event (Ghost or Monster)     |
| 2       | District Crime Family or Cultist Boss |
| 3       | Riot                                  |

### **Step 2: Determine Faction (Roll 1d6 based on Step 1)**

#### **Crime Family (1d6)**

| d6 Roll | Faction                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1-4     | District Crime Family or Families |
| 5-6     | Law Enforcement                   |

When rolling for a specific district crime family, add +1, if the highest number is rolled, the party will interact with another crime family.

| **d8 Roll** | **Faction**                                            | District        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| 1           | Vallakovich Family (Brutal Enforcers, Political Power) | Lower Vallaki   |
| 2           | Wachter Family (Manipulative, Pro-Strahd)              | Lower Vallaki   |
| 3           | Martikov Family (Bootleggers, Wereravens)              | Krezk Valley    |
| 4           | Packhounds (Werewolf Gang, Mercenaries)                | Krezk Valley    |

| 6           | Kolyana Family (Shaken Family)                         | High Barovia    |
| 7           | Zarovich Family (Enforcers, Cultists)                  | Ravenloft       |
| 8           | **Roll Twice** – Two factions in conflict              |                 |

#### **Cultists (1d6)**

| **d6 Roll** | **Faction**                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1           | Citywide Eldritch Cultists (General cult activity) |
| 2           | The Church of the Eternal Light                    |
| 3           | Witch Coven                                        |
| 4           | St. Markovia Abbey Cult (Mongrelfolk Experiments)  |
| 5           | The Drowned Circle (Druids from Yesterhill Point)  |
| 6           | **Roll Twice** – Two cult factions interacting     |

### **Step 3: Roll on the Faction's Encounter Table**

Once the faction is determined, roll on the corresponding **Random Encounter Table** for that faction.
- If **two factions** appear (rolled a 6 in Step 2), either:
    - **Roll separately** for each faction, or
    - **Create a direct conflict between them** (e.g., Wachters vs. Vallakovichs, Packhounds vs. Martikovs).
- If **Special Encounter** (rolled 19–20 in Step 1), introduce **major city events** (e.g., a **crime boss appears**, a **public execution occurs**, or the **Elder God stirs**).

### **Optional: Add District-Based Modifiers**

To add variety, tweak encounters based on the district. Crime Families in their home turf will get +1 to their rolls.

## Other Information

### Competing Interests:

- **The Party's Role**: The party is caught between these competing mafia families, each with their own agenda, and the dangerous supernatural forces of Barovia. They’ll likely have to navigate alliances, betrayals, and power struggles.
    - The Martikovs and Kolyana Families are potential allies, but their strength is weakened. They might need the party’s help to gain more power and influence, while the Vallakovich and Wachter Families see the party as useful pawns or enemies.
    - Strahd, of course, is a looming threat in the background. He may manipulate the families, using them against each other, and he might see the party as both an obstacle and a tool for his own ends.

---

### Key Interactions for the Party:

- **Strategic Alliances**: The party can play off the rivalries between the families, choosing which ones to support or betray. They may even be able to manipulate the families into fighting each other to make their own progress easier.
- **Morality and Choice**: The party will have to decide whether they want to keep their hands clean or get involved in the corruption of Barovia’s criminal world. Their choices can shape their relationship with these families, with some becoming allies and others turning into bitter enemies.
- **Supernatural Forces**: Some families (especially Strahd’s) are deeply connected to the supernatural. The party may find themselves caught between the paranormal and mafia elements, with each family trying to leverage both sides for their advantage.


Here’s how you can build a **Random Encounter Guide** for street-level interactions with members of the mafia families, the Werewolf gang, and other criminals in Barovia. You can customize it to fit specific areas (districts) or specific times of day, and adjust it based on the party’s choices, alliances, or reputation with certain families. I’ll also add a few special twists for extra tension!


#### **Werewolf Gang Encounters** (Roll 1d8):

1. **Dockside Dispute** – The party stumbles into a conflict between Werewolf gang members and rival smugglers at the docks. The Werewolves may offer the party a share of their “profits” if they intervene or intimidate the rivals, but a double-cross could be lurking.
2. **Pact of Power** – A lone Werewolf approaches the party with a cryptic offer. They claim that they can help break the curse of lycanthropy with an ancient ritual, but it will come at a price—one that may involve dark and dangerous forces.
3. **Smuggler’s Fight** – Two Werewolves are engaged in a tense argument over stolen goods. They may ask the party to settle the dispute, with an option for the party to steal the goods for themselves or sell them back to one of the mafia families.
4. **Ambush** – The party is ambushed by a small group of Werewolves while passing through the docks. The Werewolves are testing the party's strength. If the party survives, they could gain the respect of the pack, or it could escalate to further conflict if the Werewolves feel betrayed.
5. **Smuggler’s Tunnel** – The Werewolf gang offers the party a shortcut through an underground tunnel system, claiming it’s the safest route through the city. In reality, they’re sending the party through a dangerous trap, testing their loyalty.
6. **The Beast’s Hunt** – A werewolf pack member has lost control and is hunting down civilians on the docks. The party can try to stop them, but doing so will incur the wrath of the pack—unless they can somehow offer an alternative, like helping the pack find a cure.
7. **The Alpha’s Command** – The pack leader sends a few members to track down the party and offer them a mission: to hunt down a rival gang leader or a traitor within their own ranks. Completing the task could earn them an alliance with the pack.
8. **Run-in with Strahd’s Men** – The Werewolves are involved in a secret meeting with Strahd’s agents, discussing the possibility of forming an alliance. If the party stumbles upon it, they may have the chance to learn more about Strahd’s plans and the Werewolves’ secret goals.
