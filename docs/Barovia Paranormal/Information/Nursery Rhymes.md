## Strahd and Vampires

#### **Strahd’s Hunger**

_"Hush, hush, don’t make a sound,_  
_Or the pale man comes around._  
_He knocks once, he knocks twice,_  
_He’ll drain your veins as cold as ice._"

_"Silver won’t save you, nor a prayer,_  
_Best to hide, he’s everywhere._  
_Close your shutters, bolt the door,_  
_Lest you live… nevermore."_

#### **Blood on the Briar (A Rhyme About Strahd’s Vampirism)**

_"Blood on the briar, blood on the stone,_  
_Lock your doors, don’t go alone._  
_A shadow flies when the moon is bright,_  
_Hush, my child, stay in the light."_

_"Step in the dark, and he'll find you soon,_  
_Drink your breath, sing you a tune._  
_He knocks so soft, you won’t hear a sound—_  
_But open the door, and you're never found."_

#### **The Pale Man (A Rhyme About Strahd’s Vampirism)**

_The pale man walks when the sun slips low,_  
_Soft as the hush of falling snow._  
_He'll knock so light, he’ll call your name,_  
_And whisper promises sweet as rain._

_"But take his hand and you’ll grow cold,_  
_Your heart won’t beat, your flesh won’t old._  
_The pale man walks, so shut your eyes,_  
_Pray the dawn will let you rise."_

#### **Red As the Rose (Another Vampire Rhyme, Warning of Strahd’s Brides or Spawn)**

_Red as the rose, white as the bone,_  
_Three maids dance in the halls alone._  
_One sings sweet, one hums low,_  
_One weeps soft for the life she knows._

_"They drink, they twirl, they bid you stay,_  
_They kiss, they bite, they drain away._  
_Hold your breath and shut your eyes,_  
_Or wake within their arms—alive."_

#### **Softly, Softly (A Vampire Rhyme About Sleeping Victims, Or Those Being Hypnotized)**

_"Softly, softly, don’t make a sound,_  
_Close your eyes as the world spins ‘round._  
_Heavy hands, cold as stone,_  
_Hold you tight—you’re not alone."_

_"Softly, softly, whisper low,_  
_The night is deep, the moon won’t know._  
_Let your breath grow slow and still—_  
_Drink the dark, embrace the chill."_

## The Elder God & Eldritch Horrors

#### **The Watcher in the Deep**

_The sea is restless, the tides are wide._  
_A voice that whispers, a hand so thin,_  
_It calls your name and beckons you in._"

_The dark below has no dry ground._  
_If you hear the tolling bell,_  
_You’re lost beneath the ocean’s swell."_

#### **The Black Sea Sings (A Warning About the Elder God Beneath the Sea)**

_"The black sea sings with a voice so deep,_  
_It calls for children lost in sleep._  
_Drift too near and you’ll be drowned,_  
_Sleeping safe beneath the sound."_

_"The waves will whisper, low and sweet,_  
_The tide will curl around your feet._  
_Once you hear the ocean sigh,_  
_You’ll live below, and never die."_

#### **The Drowned God Calls (A Rhyme About the Elder God Beneath the Waves)**

_"The drowned god calls beneath the waves,_  
_Where sailors sleep in salt-bound graves._  
_He sings with mouths that should not be,_  
_And dreams in coils beneath the sea."_

_"Step too close and hear him speak,_  
_His voice will slip into your sleep._  
_One by one, you’ll learn his name—_  
_And never wake again the same."_

#### **The Sleeper Beneath (A Chant for Children, About the Sleeping Horror Below)**

_"Hush now, hush now, close your eyes,_  
_The sleeper stirs when the seabird cries._  
_The tide runs red, the wind smells sweet—_  
_He wakes, he wakes, in the blackest deep."_

_"Turn the cup, pour the sand,_  
_Draw the circle in your hand._  
_Hush now, hush now, hear the waves,_  
_The sleeper waits beyond the grave."_

## Argynvost

#### **Argynvost’s Fall**

_"The dragon shone in silver bright,_  
_He led his knights into the fight._  
_They rode with honor, sword and shield,_  
_But none returned from battlefield._"

_"Their bones lie cold, their souls won’t rest,_  
_Their fortress ruined, their banners tressed._  
_And in the night, when wind does moan,_  
_You’ll hear them march, but not alone."_

#### **Argynvost’s Flame (The Fall of Argynvost and His Silver Order)**

_"The silver knights rode proud and true,_  
_With shining swords and banners blue._  
_They swore to fight the devil’s reign,_  
_But all that’s left is dust and flame."_

_"A dragon fell, his wings spread wide,_  
_The fire died, the world grew night._  
_Now ghosts ride forth in hollow mail,_  
_Seeking vengeance doomed to fail."_

## Ghosts

#### **The Specter’s Lullaby**

_"When the candle flickers blue,_  
_A ghost is standing next to you._  
_When the walls begin to weep,_  
_The dead have risen from their sleep._"

_"If the mirror shows a face,_  
_Run, run! Leave this place!_  
_For if you linger, if you stay,_  
_You’ll never see the break of day."_

#### **Who Taps on the Window? (A Rhyme About a Ghostly Presence)**

_"Who taps on the window when you’re asleep?_  
_Who stands at the foot of your bed so deep?_  
_Don’t look, don’t stir, don’t make a sound,_  
_Or else you’ll never be safe or found."_

_"A whisper, a sigh, a cold little breath,_  
_Hiding away won’t keep you from death._  
_Close your eyes, count to three,_  
_Pray that the ghost isn’t looking for thee."_

#### **Little Molly’s Shadow (A Warning About Wandering Spirits)**

_"Little Molly lost her way,_  
_Down by the hollow where lost things play._  
_She danced with the shadows, twirled with the mist,_  
_Now she is nothing—she does not exist."_

_"Her mother called, her father cried,_  
_But all that answered was the tide._  
_If you see her standing there,_  
_Run, my love, don’t stop to stare."_

#### **The Hanged Man’s Warning**

_"One, two, don’t look up._  
_Three, four, don’t step in muck._  
_Five, six, the rope still swings._  
_Seven, eight, hear how it sings._

_Nine, ten, his feet don’t touch._  
_Eleven, twelve, don’t stare too much._  
_Thirteen, fourteen, whispers low,_  
_Fifteen, sixteen, time to go._

_Seventeen, eighteen, step just right,_  
_Nineteen, twenty—gone from sight._  
_If you linger, if you stay,_  
_The hanged man takes you far away."_
