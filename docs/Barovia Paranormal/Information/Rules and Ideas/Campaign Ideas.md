##### Notes

Abandoned house, nobody goes near, but they don't understand why. Sometimes there are kids outside, saying there is a monster inside, but they are just "hooligans". Agency has a feeling it's paranormal as the kids are reported looking similar or almost the same across dozens of years.

After Death house, everything goes white, each character wakes up (separately?) in an other-worldly area with an old woman seated at a table. She beckons them forward and draws cards and hints at a force, an evil that overshadows the city Barovia.

**HOW DO CHARACTERS GET KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS PARANORMAL SIGHTINGS?**
-Agency Assignments

All of Barovia is a big city with the villages as different districts

Strahd works behind the curtains to influence and shape the city

Lesser vampires are more bestial - body horror like long spike like tongues

Paranormal activity everywhere in the city

People don't believe in the paranormal, or try to explain it away
People don't know about Strahd

Add in Speakeasies

Add in flu epidemic
Posters of spreading epidemic
Don't cough
Stop the epidemic

There are a few Helsing like Vampire Hunters that could help or hinder the party

A group of "night watch" guards that will hinder players at night

Young girl held hostage by auntie who controls her with Bell. Players are less to think auntie is evil and eats people, but it's the young girl who's possessed.

Man walking around with lantern, kind of creepy, always looking for oil to keep lantern lit. Shadow creature making him keep the lantern lit to keep it alive, but man doesn't know it's to keep it alive

Create sections for each district with the recommended level, key locations, people, and list of events.

Create page for each location, person, and event
Play more sandbox-like with agency headquarters that collects rumors and stories
Headquarters is a tabloid
players are investigators,  reporters?

Death house= Murder House

Ghost Tram/Train

Serial Killer

Vampires are broken in 2 categories, vampires and spawn
Vampires are more traditional
Spawn have beast like properties, e.g long grotesque tongues, claws...

Firearms do nothing against ghosts, only a silver tipped sword or iron

Vending machines for potions and other gear
Vending machines were usually found in factories, in post offices, and at train stations.

### From Candela Obscura:
#### Create a circle (Detective Agency)

| D6  | Questions                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | You have all known one another for a long time, but your circle was recently formed. Why were you brought together, and how do you each feel about it? |
| 2   | You all share a common goal that's secret to the Lightkeepers of Barovia. What is it?                                                                  |
| 3   | You've never met, but members of your circle are infamous. What did they do, and how do you each feel about it?                                        |
| 4   | Your circle was retired, but Barovia recently brought you back. Why were you all dismissed, and why did they call you in again?                        |
| 5   | Your circle once did something incredibly heroic. What did you do, and do other people know about it?                                                  |
| 6   | Your circle once did something horribly evil. What did you do, and how do you seek abosoution?                                                         |
#### Name the agency:
Naming something is very powerful. You may imbue something with intent or recognition— you could even transform something you fear into something you love with the right name.
When you choose your circle’s name, you should consider how your team feels about their place within Candela Obscura, or how Candela Obscura as a whole governs their circles. The name might serve as an invitation, an oath, or a shackle.
Though you could choose anything, the name should, in some way, define your group. Perhaps it refers to your purpose, your approach to investigations, your scope within the organization, your location, etc. For example: the Circle of Quiet Commons, the Circle of Vim & Vigor, the Circle of Squares.

#### Choose a Chapter House Location:
Decide where your agency works out of and what it looks like:
Example Chapter Houses
The EmptyOffice: On the fourth floor of a medical building in Silverslip is an office that belongs to a Doctor Lygon, though no such person is known to work there.
The Boot and Saddle: In the backrooms of a run-down bar in South Soffit, there is a small but functional space for Candela Obscura members to meet.
The Rust Warren: An underground bunker in the Haven Hills left over from the war, it has been utilized by members of Candela Obscura when needed.

What is your agency working toward?

#### Assignments
Assignments are the individual mysteries Candela Obscura asks a circle to investigate. An assignment might arise from a strange death or highly unusual situation that requires the group’s expertise in the occult. Each assignment will generally last a single session of gameplay, though it could last longer if you and your table decide to take a break and pick it up at another time.

Rudolph Van Richten as a legendary loose-cannon federal agent going undercover as a lounge singer for "one last job," Ez his no-nonsense younger partner.

Baron Vargas as a disloyal capo, looking to become the Don.

The Abbot as a corrupt parish priest.

The Martikovs as a "legit" supplier of fine wines, that Strahd is looking to strong-arm into his bootlegging rackets. "Nice vineyard ya got here. Shame if anything happened to it."

The werewolves as the vicious "Westies"-style gang that Strahd does business with occasionally, but can never become "made" into vampires as they're not full-blooded Barovians

Tatyana is an actress/singer who is growing in popularity in the city. Her talents caught Strahd's eye in the theater/lounge but she ran off with the younger brother.

Izek Strazni is a corrupt cop who struggles with being corrupt.

The Knights of the Silver Order are another rival gang whose sole purpose is to ruin Strahd's business practices.

The bottom floor of Ravenloft can act as an abandoned railway station (the flame that teleports you) with an elevator trap as a one off before becoming an actual elevator to the teleport spots within the castle.

As for how you could treat the places…

Barovia, because it is close to Ravenloft, would be much more clean as opposed to Vallaki. Strahd, for all that he is, is a well kept man. He would not want the blocks near his building bringing down the property value. He likes to appear regal and professional. so he would help “keep the streets clean” so that it gives a better illusion of welcoming.

Vallaki would be closer to your slums and urban sprawl. The Blue Water Inn would be akin to a speak easy, which would be a way for Strahd to try and Strong arm the Martikovs like FinnMacFinneus said, with him knowing their little side business. The the vistani camp can be outfitted into A: an immigrant sub-culture (like Little Italy or China Town), or B a homeless encampment. The coffin shop is your local Morgue, the stock yard turns into a mom and pop shop that has a back lot that they can’t do much with.

Kretzk would be closer to your rural outskirts of a city, much more quiet and isolated (this is coming from the fact that Kretzk’s economy was based around farming). Major Problems being the Werewolves.

Berez would be a mass of burnt ruins as opposed to flooded, as working conditions weren’t great, so a “fire in a sweatshop” was “bound to happen” (Strahd to torched a building and let it get out of hand)

MTG has a setting called "[The Streets of New Capenna](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Streets_of_New_Capenna)." That setting and the lore contained therein is a gold mine for 1920s Curse of Strahd. I am currently working on my own campaign featuring Capenna as a Domain of Dread. You could try something like that.
