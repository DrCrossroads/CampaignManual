## CURING MADNESS
A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.

Losing madness points can have different effects and detriments. Below is a list of effects that are triggered when your madness ability score is reduced to the value listed. When you gain an effect of madness from a reduction of your madness ability score, you retain that madness until your madness points are raised above that point again. If you gain a madness when your Wisdom score drops below 15, you retain that madness until its raised to or above 15.
