## DMG Rules

New ability score

### SANITY SCORE
Consider using the Sanity score if your campaign revolves around entities of an utterly alien and unspeakable nature, such as Great Cthulhu, whose powers and minions can shatter a character's mind. A character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in the face of insane circumstances, while a character with low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted by eldritch horrors that are beyond normal reason.

**Sanity Checks**. You might ask characters to make a Sanity check in place of an Intelligence check to recall lore about the alien creatures of madness featured in your campaign, to decipher the writings of raving lunatics, or to learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore. You might also call for a Sanity check when a character tries one of the following activities:
- Deciphering a piece of text written in a language so alien that it threatens to break a character's mind
- Overcoming the lingering effects of madness
- Comprehending a piece of alien magic foreign to all normal understanding of magic

**Sanity Saving Throws**. You might call for a Sanity saving throw when a character runs the risk of succumbing to madness, such as in the following situations:
- Seeing a creature from the Far Realm or other alien realms for the first time
- Making direct contact with the mind of an alien creature
- Being subjected to spells that affect mental stability, such as the insanity option of the symbol spell Passing through a demiplane built on alien physics Resisting an effect conferred by an attack or spell that deals psychic damage

Critical fails with this check may result in experiencing [[Madness]].


## Feat for Sanity

#### Comforting Words

- Increase your Sanity ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Once per long rest, immediately before any creature within 30 feet of you makes a Sanity saving throw, you may speak words of solace that relieve some of the horrors they experience. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within range, including yourself, gains advantage on the Sanity saving throw.
- You gain proficiency in Sanity saving throws.


## Optional Rule
Madness points are a new mechanic that measures your current sanity level. Considering the amount of extraordinary and horrific things adventurers experience, it stands to reason that one's sanity may be tested. From novice green horns to even the most weathered explorer, everyone has a breaking point.

When a character is faced with a situation that could test their sanity, its called a madness event. It is essentially up to the DM what constitutes a madness event as well as the saving throw DC. DMs should work with players before beginning to discuss different factors that could lead to a madness event.

#### Madness Points
Madness points are based on your mental stability and ability to handle stressful or frightful situations. Each different ability score counteracts madness and insanity in different ways. Intelligence helps you rationalize and use logic to overcome madness. Wisdom allows your existing knowledge of the world and its elements to combat madness. Finally, if you are cunning and manipulative, Charisma is best for steeling your mind against assaults.

When you begin a one shot or campaign featuring this system, each character chooses a mental ability stat listed above. That stat becomes your Madness ability score. Once chosen, it cannot be changed.

You have a number of madness points equal to the chosen ability's score.

#### Madness Saving Throw
When an event or situation occurs that tests your mental limits, the DM will ask for a saving throw, using the chosen ability. The DC of the saving throw will be situational and dependent on the severity of the madness events.
If you succeed a saving throw, you've managed to fight against the incoming madness and you remain unaffected. At times a success could provide a benefit.

If you fail a madness saving throw, you lose 1 madness point. Immediately, roll on one of the madness charts to determine the effect.

If you roll a natural 1, you lose 2 madness points. If you roll a natural 20 on the saving throw, you regain 1 madness point and roll on the Moment of Courage table.

Each different type of madness and effect has a specific duration. When you are affected by madness, the DM will explain the effect and the duration.

#### Losing Madness Points
When you fail a madness saving throw, there are different charts depending on the cause and severity of the madness. The effect caused is tied to the event that caused it. As stated before, its up to the DM's discretion what constitutes a madness saving throw, but the following are a few situations that may require one:
- You witness a horrific scene, such as an eldritch horror appearing and attacking you.
- An ally is killed in front of you.
- You fail a death saving throw.
- You are frightened for longer than 1 minute.
- An enormous or incredibly terrifying monster dashes toward you.

#### Regaining Madness Points
Once a madness point is lost, it can be regained in one of three ways.

- At the end of a long rest, you recover a number of madness points equal to your chosen ability's modifier. For example, a character with an Intelligence of 16, has 16madness points and regains 3 at the end of a long rest.
- When you are missing madness points and have Lesser Restoration cast on you, you regain 1 point and can end one madness currently affecting you. If you have more than one, roll to randomly determine which effect ends. Similarly, a Greater Restoration spell recovers 2 madness points and ends two type of madness effecting you. You can only benefit from Lesser Restoration or Greater Restoration in this way once each per long rest.
- When you make a madness saving throw and you roll a 20on the d20, you regain 1 madness point as well as a Moment of Courage.
- Madness points can also be restored when you accomplish great acts. When you score a critical hit or kill a creature, for example, your DM may grant you a madness point.
