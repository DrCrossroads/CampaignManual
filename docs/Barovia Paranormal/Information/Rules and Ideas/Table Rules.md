1. The GM has the last say on any ruling.
2. Only flat dice, seen on the table count.
3. I play by the Rule of Cool. Meaning, I encourage you to come up with really clever plans.
4. Player-Determined Inspiration - Once per session, I encourage you to award one single player inspiration, which gives advantage on a roll. I will still award Inspiration from On High as well.
5. Health potions can be used as a bonus action. If health potions are used during combat as an action, you will receive the full effect, but if they are used as a bonus action, you roll the amount you heal.
6. Rolling a natural 20 on initiative allows you to pick your place in the turn order.
7. Crit-surance - When a 20 is rolled on an attack, you will use the max damage on one die and then roll the damage for the extra.
8. I encourage clever ideas in any situation and will use the following combat options:
    - Disarm: On a successful hit, you can forgo damage to disarm your opponent.
    - Morale: Enemies can be demoralized and flee. This may lead to them regrouping and returning, though. And remember, you can always flee as well.
9. Dying - When a player's character drops to 0 HP, this does not mean they are out of the game. The player will roll a d20 and add their Con modifier for a death save. On a roll of -6 or below, the character is dead. A roll of 0 to -5 means the character is unconscious, 1-8 is a serious injury, 9-18 is a major injury, and 19-20 is a minor injury. Serious and major injuries give a level of exhaustion and are a -5 to subsequent death saves.
