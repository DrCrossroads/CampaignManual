### **The Mists**
Strahd created the mists to hold back Kth'Vulgaroth's power, containing it in the city of Barovia. The mists circle the city, enveloping the forest on the outskirts and can be seen hovering over the Barovia Sea.
If people venture into the forest, they will experience strange happenings including:
- **Strange anomalies**: The forest could be a warped, unnatural place where reality shifts. Time loops, figures flicker in and out, or the trees whisper secrets.
- **Forgotten ruins**: A ruined chapel, an abandoned manor swallowed by vines, or an old mob hideout where ghosts relive their last moments.
- **Druidic activity**: The druids could be more like doomsday cultists, worshipping the Elder God in secret, performing bizarre rituals.

### **Eldritch Weather Effects**
The **Mist is alive**, shifting and warping reality. Here are some **unnatural weather effects** that occur when the Mist **fluctuates or weakens**:

1. **The Bleeding Fog** – The Mist turns **red**, dripping onto buildings. Anyone exposed must roll **Wisdom (DC 14) or suffer waking nightmares**.
2. **The Hollow Moon** – The moon **vanishes from the sky** for a full night, replaced by a **gaping black void**. Monsters are **more aggressive** during this time.
3. **The Whispering Storm** – A storm of **black rain** falls, carrying **murmuring voices**. If you **listen too closely**, you suffer **temporary madness**.
4. **Reality Slippage** – Buildings **shift and change**, roads **loop endlessly**, and people **momentarily flicker** out of existence.

### **Major Eldritch Weather Events**

#### **1. The Weeping Storm**
- A **slow, drizzling rain** begins to fall, but instead of water, it is a thick, **viscous black liquid** that clings to buildings and streets.
- People who are caught in it hear **faint whispers** that seem to come from inside their own minds. Some hear their **own voice begging for help**, while others hear **loved ones speaking from beyond the grave**.
- Any reflections in puddles show **a version of the city that is ruined and long abandoned**, as if viewed from the distant future—or a timeline that never was.

#### **2. The Hollow Sun**
- At noon, the **sun dims to a sickly gray** and casts no warmth. Despite this, **shadows lengthen and twist unnaturally**, stretching toward something unseen in the distance.
- Anyone who looks directly at the sun sees **a massive, unmoving eye** staring back at them. Even after looking away, they feel **watched**.
- A deep unease spreads through the city—people become **agitated, aggressive, or eerily silent**, as if something is **listening to their thoughts**.

#### **3. The Night that Wouldn’t End**
- The **moon refuses to set**, locking the city in **perpetual twilight** even as clocks continue to tick forward.
- Streetlights and lanterns burn dimmer, and eventually **fail altogether**, leaving only **an unnatural, blue-hued glow** from the sky.
- The air feels **thicker**, like trying to breathe underwater. People report **seeing shadowy figures standing in doorways**, but when investigated, they are gone.

#### **4. The Rains of Reflection**
- A sudden downpour floods the streets, but **every surface touched by the rain** becomes **highly reflective**, turning every puddle, window, and metal surface into a **distorted mirror**.
- Anyone who stares into their own reflection for too long sees **themselves doing things they have never done**, as if glimpsing an alternate version of their life.
- Some claim that **figures are watching from within the reflections**, waiting for something.

#### **5. The City of Echoes**
- A storm rolls through, but instead of thunder, **distant screams, laughter, and snippets of old conversations** crackle in the sky.
- Voices of **long-dead residents** echo through the streets, **repeating past events as if they are happening now**.
- For a brief moment, the **barrier between past and present weakens**, and locations in the city flicker to **a different time**, revealing glimpses of lost history—or a future yet to come.

#### **6. The Awakening Mist**
- The mist that normally clings to the outskirts of Barovia City **surges inward**, consuming entire districts.
- Within the mist, **doors lead to different places than they should**, and time seems to **skip forward or backward unpredictably**.
- Some who step into the mist vanish entirely, while others emerge… **changed**.

#### **7. The Silent Hour**
- Without warning, **all sound ceases** across the entire city. No voices, no footsteps, no wind. The world becomes **a perfect, absolute silence**.
- Even attempting to speak results in **nothing but silence**, yet those affected can still "hear" their own thoughts **as if someone else is speaking them aloud**.
- Just before the hour ends, an **ear-splitting shriek** echoes across the city, shaking windows and **leaving some with bleeding ears**.

#### **8. The Starfall of Eyes**
- The night sky **fills with shooting stars**, but instead of burning up, they **stop midair**, hovering like **watchful, glowing orbs** above the city.
- Those who stare too long feel **something staring back**—and some see the stars **blinking** at them.
- For weeks after, people report **dreams of an endless void**, with **something massive stirring just beyond the stars**.
