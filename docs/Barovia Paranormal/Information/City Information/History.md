The party has gone through these events before, but each to has restarted the cycle. When they are in a death state, they hear voices "Restart the Cycle."

**The Rise of Barovia:** Long before Strahd’s rise to power, Barovia was a small, humble village by the sea. The land was full of mystery and dark secrets, with strange myths swirling around the waters. Those who ventured out into the mists rolling in at night or tried to explore the deeper waters of the sea often never returned, their fates consumed by the unknowable abyss. Beneath the waves, in the inky depths, something slumbered. It was an ancient, malevolent force, older than the land itself — _Kth'Vulgaroth, The Eye of the Depths, a primordial god of the deep, a being of chaos and madness whose slumber held the very fabric of reality in place.

**Strahd's Encounter:** Strahd, a simple adventurer, was on the sea with a group of seven. The seven included his wife, Tatyana. During the trip, they ran into a storm, the worst the village had ever seen. Whispers echoed in the mists, beckoning them in deeper. The waters swirled violently beneath them and opened up. The boat, plummeted to the ocean floor, crashing into the rocks below.

Strahd crawled from the wreckage. The broken bodies of his companions lay dead around him. He wandered through the underwater temple. He saw his wife, dead and limp in front of a large cell like structure.

The great god _Kth'Vulgaroth_ reached out, awakening from its eons of slumber. The creature did not speak directly, but its will was felt in Strahd’s mind, offering power beyond imagination, immortality, and dominion over all of Barovia in exchange for releasing it from its prison. Strahd thought he was going crazy, that he was dying. The voice boomed in his mind and brushed against his skin.

Strahd, terrified yet intoxicated by the promises, unwittingly accepted the pact — but there was a price. The god didn’t wish to be a passive prisoner. It sought to rise once again, to spread its influence across the world, and its awakening would unmake reality itself. Kth'Vulgaroth transformed Strahd into a vampire, corrupting his soul with an insatiable thirst for blood and an immortal lifespan. Strahd, now bound to the god, realized the horror of what he had unleashed: his very existence had become tied to the god’s restless slumber. If Kth'Vulgaroth awoke, the world would fall into eternal madness.

**The Guilt and the Curse:** Strahd tried to distance himself from the god’s influence, but it was too late. The transformation twisted his mind, and the power of immortality came with endless torment. Over the centuries, Strahd’s mind became consumed by guilt. The villagers, the innocents of Barovia, were unwitting pawns in the game he had set in motion. He began to see himself not as a victim, but as the only one capable of preventing the utter destruction of everything he had known.

In time, Strahd isolated himself and grew more paranoid. He built a city around the cursed lake where the creature slept, calling it Barovia, an imposing fortress to protect the land from the horrors that could emerge. Strahd imposed order, ruthlessly destroying those who ventured too close to the lake, those who sought to release Kth'Vulgaroth. He created the mists — an unnatural fog that would shroud the land and act as a barrier to anyone seeking to cross into the god's domain. The mists were a reflection of his growing obsession and his guilt. They were a shield, but also a prison. As time wore on, Strahd justified his cruel, authoritarian rule by convincing himself that the greater good demanded his tyrannical behavior. He became the protector of the people, an unwilling god-king whose reign was necessary to stave off the horrors that would come if the Elder God awoke.

**The Binding Rituals:** Over the centuries, Strahd has enacted numerous rituals to keep Kth'Vulgaroth bound. These rituals have taken the form of cruel and dark rites, some tied to his vampiric nature, others to his own powers. The rituals are secret, performed in the deepest, most forgotten parts of Barovia, but Strahd knows that with every passing year, the binding weakens.

1. **The Veil of the Mists:** The mists that encircle Barovia are not merely a natural occurrence. Strahd has bound them to his own will, using a combination of dark magic and the strange powers granted by Kth'Vulgaroth's influence. The mists act as a barrier, a prison for the god, keeping its dreams from bleeding into the world. If the mists were to ever be dispelled, the influence of the god would spread like a flood.
2. **The Rites of Silence:** Strahd regularly sacrifices his own blood to perform ancient rites, which he learned from forgotten tomes at the Amber Temple. These rituals, combined with the psychic link between him and Kth'Vulgaroth, serve to suppress the god’s dreams, preventing it from fully waking. Strahd, however, does not know that these rites come at a cost — the longer he maintains them, the more he risks losing his own sanity and soul. The ritual requires more than just power; it requires the constant sacrifice of the vampire lord’s humanity, further twisting his sense of self.
3. **The Heart of Barovia:** Strahd has placed a powerful artifact, known as the **Heart of Barovia**, at the center of his castle, Castle Ravenloft. This relic was created in an attempt to bind Kth'Vulgaroth’s essence into the land itself. It is a source of both immense power and terrible danger. The Heart siphons off the god's influence and channels it into Barovia’s very soil, keeping it grounded and disconnected from the wider world. If the Heart were to ever be destroyed, Kth'Vulgaroth would awaken in full force, bringing about the complete unraveling of reality.

**The Evolution of Strahd’s Mindset:** As centuries passed, Strahd’s mind twisted further. Initially driven by guilt and a sense of duty, Strahd came to see his role as the only one who could protect Barovia from the impending madness. His cruelty grew, as did his belief that the ends justified the means. He began to see any attempt to undermine his authority, to challenge his rule, as a direct threat to the one thing keeping Kth'Vulgaroth sealed. Strahd saw the people of Barovia not as citizens, but as pawns in a much larger game. They were meant to suffer, to obey, to remain ignorant of the true horrors beneath the waves.

In his warped mind, Strahd became a protector in his own eyes. The terrible things he did — the destruction of families, the imposition of eternal night — were all done for the “greater good.” His obsessive need to maintain control of Barovia and the mists only deepened over time, and he became convinced that if the people knew the truth, they would rise up against him. So, he kept the curse of Barovia alive, and the people trapped in a nightmare, all in an attempt to keep the god dormant.

**Summary of Strahd's Mindset Shift:**

- **Initial Motivation:** Strahd starts as a hero, driven by guilt, fear, and a desire to prevent Kth'Vulgaroth from awakening. He believes his transformation into a vampire is a punishment and a necessary burden.
- **Twist:** Over centuries, Strahd's mind becomes twisted by the isolation and the corruption of his vampiric nature. He starts to see himself as a protector, convinced that the suffering he causes is justified by the greater good of keeping Kth'Vulgaroth at bay.
- **Corruption:** Strahd, in his isolation, eventually believes that the only way to keep the land safe is to maintain absolute control. He becomes more tyrannical, seeing his cruel actions as necessary to protect the people from the madness of Kth'Vulgaroth.
- **Final Delusion:** Strahd comes to believe that he is the only one capable of keeping the god at bay and that his rule is an unassailable necessity. His mind slowly unravels, just as the rituals he performs are beginning to lose their potency.

**Traits**

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Kth'Vulgaroth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Immutable Form.** Kth'Vulgaroth is immune to any effect that would alter its form.

**Dreams of the Abyss.** Kth'Vulgaroth can subtly affect the minds of those within 120 feet of it. Any creature that starts its turn within this radius must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and become frightened until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

**Deepwater Call (Recharge 5-6).** Kth'Vulgaroth can summon 1d4*2 Deep Ones or similar horrors (CR 3 or lower) from the deep to rise from the water, appearing within 30 feet of it. These creatures are under Kth'Vulgaroth’s control, though they are destroyed when it is defeated.

---

**Actions**

**Multiattack.** Kth'Vulgaroth makes two attacks: one with its **Claw** and one with its **Tentacle**.

Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Kth'Vulgaroth can't use this tentacle on another target.

**Mind Rend (Recharge 5-6).** Kth'Vulgaroth targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 42 (12d6) psychic damage, and have its thoughts scrambled. The target becomes confused for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

---

**Legendary Actions**

Kth'Vulgaroth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Kth'Vulgaroth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Tentacle Lash.** Kth'Vulgaroth makes one **Tentacle** attack.

**Terrifying Visage.** Each creature of Kth'Vulgaroth's choice within 60 feet that can see it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Call of the Deep.** Kth'Vulgaroth targets a creature within 60 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pulled into the nearest water source and begin to drown. The creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns as if the water was trying to crush it. The creature can make another Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

---

**Lair Actions**

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Kth'Vulgaroth can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

4. **Water Surge.** A 20-foot square of water (from nearby lakes, rivers, or fountains) surges forth, creating a wave of force. All creatures in the area must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or take 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
5. **Mind Twist.** Kth'Vulgaroth distorts reality, causing all creatures within 120 feet to experience fragmented, maddening visions. Each creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and become paralyzed until the start of its next turn.
6. **Dark Submersion.** A deep fog of oily darkness spreads across the lair, reducing visibility to 10 feet. Any creature within the fog that starts its turn there must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and be blinded until the end of its next turn.

During the final battle, a portal opens to the stars beyond, sucking everyone into it. DC 13 Strength check, on success, the player keeps their footing, on a failure, the player is pulled 10ft closer to the portal. In the final moments, a larger tentacled monster starts to force its way out. When Kth-Vulgaroth dies, the portal closes, the temple collapses, players will need to make their way to the surface. They find that they're in the ocean with the city in the distance. The mist has lifted. There's driftwood they can use to rest.

**Additional Notes for Campaign:**

- **Strahd’s Role:** Strahd serves as the "warden" of the lake, keeping the horrors at bay and preventing Kth'Vulgaroth’s influence from spreading. His actions as a vampire lord are motivated by fear and his twisted sense of duty. He might be a tragic villain who truly believes he's keeping Barovia safe from annihilation, even if his methods are oppressive and destructive.
- **The Underwater Temple:** The Amber Temple, in your narrative, could be the final place where the players learn more about Kth'Vulgaroth and its true nature. It was built as a prison by ancient sorcerers who once fought against the god. Strange rites, submerged ruins, and underwater monsters can make this a chilling locale where the players must face their own fears.
- **After Strahd’s Defeat:** Once Strahd is defeated, Kth'Vulgaroth stirs fully, causing even more Lovecraftian horrors to infest Barovia. The players now face a world rapidly descending into madness, with terrifying creatures like Deep Ones and other abyssal beings coming from the water.

**1. Psychic Distortion Zones**

- **Concept**: As the battle intensifies, the reality around Kth'Vulgaroth becomes more unstable. The players might start to feel the world bend and shift unnaturally as their thoughts become distorted. These effects could be felt more acutely in certain areas of the battlefield.
- **Implementation**: As part of its lair actions, Kth'Vulgaroth could create areas of psychic distortion. These could be represented by areas that shift on the battlefield each round (perhaps 10-foot squares) or by specific points of psychic disturbance where creatures within them must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on all rolls until they leave the area. This adds chaos to movement and positioning.

**2. Unleashing the Depths**

- **Concept**: Throughout the battle, Kth'Vulgaroth can bring the very ocean to the surface, with immense pressure pushing against the players. Every so often, the water would come in from above or below, swirling around them, creating environmental hazards.
- **Implementation**: Perhaps the party finds themselves in an area surrounded by water—either they’re fighting on a boat, in an ancient temple submerged in the depths, or near a powerful, rising ocean. Kth'Vulgaroth could periodically flood parts of the battlefield (this could happen every 2–3 rounds). Creatures in flooded areas are not only at risk of drowning (as described in the **Call of the Deep**) but also take increased damage from water-based abilities. This increases the threat to anyone near water sources.

**3. Madness of the Abyss**

- **Concept**: In addition to Kth'Vulgaroth's **Dreams of the Abyss**, creatures within the monster's aura of madness could begin seeing things from the abyssal plane or hearing whispers of unimaginable horrors, heightening the mental strain.
- **Implementation**: Perhaps certain players are susceptible to being driven to madness if they fail their Wisdom saving throws against **Dreams of the Abyss** multiple times. After three failed saves, a player could be subjected to a permanent effect (e.g., they become cursed, losing their action or ability to cast spells for one turn per failed Wisdom save). This adds a long-term tension to the encounter, as players not only need to avoid the immediate damage, but also fear what prolonged exposure to Kth'Vulgaroth’s influence might do to their sanity.

**4. The Final Bargain**

- **Concept**: The villain who had been keeping Kth'Vulgaroth at bay could have left behind a corrupted artifact, offering the players a dangerous choice—whether to use it to potentially deal a blow to Kth'Vulgaroth or to make a sacrifice that will bring about more death.
- **Implementation**: Perhaps there’s a magical artifact, an ancient book, or a cursed object that can be used to disrupt Kth'Vulgaroth’s powers but at a terrible cost. For example, using the artifact could grant a massive advantage (like temporarily weakening Kth'Vulgaroth’s resistances or forcing it to make disadvantageous attacks), but it might have horrific consequences: a creature may be sacrificed to fuel its power, or the wielder may slowly lose their mind to the same influence Kth'Vulgaroth has on others.

**5. Environmental Hazards**

- **Concept**: The environment could be a living nightmare. The arena itself might be in a constant state of transformation, like shifting tides, constantly rising water levels, collapsing structures, or crumbling ruins, all while Kth'Vulgaroth remains in the center, manipulating reality around them.
- **Implementation**: On certain turns, you could have parts of the battlefield (such as buildings or statues) collapse, or creatures like Deep Ones might rise out of the water. These things could block line of sight, forcing players to be more strategic with their movement and positioning. You could also have shifting terrain or dangerous spots (e.g., collapsing platforms, sections of the floor cracking and giving way to more dangerous terrain below). These hazards would encourage players to remain on their toes and prevent them from settling into a comfortable position.

**6. Cosmic Knowledge**

- **Concept**: As the encounter progresses, Kth'Vulgaroth might start to toy with the players, offering them glimpses into forbidden knowledge, luring them with truths that are too terrible to comprehend.
- **Implementation**: Once it’s below half health, Kth'Vulgaroth could use a legendary action that forces each player to make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 20). On a failure, they would be flooded with cryptic visions of the cosmos, revealing terrifying truths about the nature of reality itself (e.g., glimpses of the far-reaching horrors of the Far Realm, the destruction of worlds, or the unending void). These visions could deal psychic damage or cause a temporary reduction in a stat like Wisdom or Intelligence, making it harder for the players to fight back.

**7. Victory Comes at a Price**

- **Concept**: Kth'Vulgaroth's defeat could trigger an event that brings about some catastrophic consequence—perhaps not the end of the world, but a major shift in the campaign’s setting.
- **Implementation**: Upon Kth'Vulgaroth’s death, the ritual that held it in place could reverse, causing something else to happen that’s both exciting and terrifying. Perhaps the ocean recedes entirely, or instead, massive flooding overtakes the land, submerging the world. Alternatively, Kth'Vulgaroth’s death might open the way for other horrors from the Far Realm to pour through, setting up the potential for a new campaign or a lasting consequence in the world.

**8. The Villain's Legacy**

- **Concept**: The villain who kept Kth'Vulgaroth imprisoned could be revealed to have left behind a contingency plan, possibly a final confrontation between the players and the villain’s own mind (perhaps his mind lives on within the artifact).
- **Implementation**: As a final twist, the players might need to defeat an illusionary version of the villain—or a portion of the villain's essence—who has become one with the abomination they sought to control. The players could fight against the villain’s mind, now manipulated by Kth'Vulgaroth’s influence. This adds a sense of closure to the plot while still keeping the stakes high.

**9. Tidal Wave Finish**

- **Concept**: Kth'Vulgaroth could have a final, desperate move to submerge the battlefield entirely, washing away anything in its path. This could signal the final phase of the battle.
- **Implementation**: In the final moments of its death throes, Kth'Vulgaroth could unleash a tidal wave, flooding the area and forcing the players to make a series of challenging saving throws to avoid being swept away or drowned, creating an exciting, last-ditch effort where the party’s resourcefulness will be tested.

---

**Conclusion:**

The battle with Kth'Vulgaroth could become not only a fight for survival but also an exploration of the psychological and physical challenges posed by facing an entity that twists reality and sanity. The layered environmental effects, desperate choices, and environmental consequences would keep players on edge, turning what could be a straightforward boss fight into an unforgettable, narrative-shifting experience.
