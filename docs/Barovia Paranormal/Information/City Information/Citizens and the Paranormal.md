## Blind to the Horrors or not?
Which Option Works Better for Your Campaign?

The best choice depends on the kind of experience you want for your players:

**For a slow, investigative, and mysterious atmosphere** where players gradually learn the truth and uncover secrets, it’s likely better if the citizens are blind to the horrors. This allows your players to feel like they are learning the truth that others don’t know, making the horror feel more existential and gradual. It allows the game to focus more on investigation, discovery, and the unraveling of the world.

**For a tense, oppressive, and psychological horror atmosphere** where the world feels like it's on the brink of collapse, and the players are trying to stop a nightmare that everyone already knows about, it would work better if everyone is aware of the horrors. This will build a sense of paranoia, dread, and inevitable doom, where the party’s actions have to fight against the tide of societal decay.

Both approaches can work wonderfully depending on what tone you want for your campaign, but I would recommend considering whether you want your campaign to be about discovery and revelation or about struggling against an inevitable horror that the world already knows exists. Both approaches can evoke powerful emotions, but the pace and direction of the story will vary greatly depending on the choice you make!


### Citizens Blind to the Horrors (Unaware)

If the citizens of Barovia are blind to the horrors around them, they would be oblivious to the full scale of the cosmic horrors, and their lives would be shaped by ignorance of the true nature of their world. However, this doesn’t mean that the horrors wouldn’t still affect them—it just means they don’t fully understand what’s happening.

#### Pros:

**Eerie, Unsettling Atmosphere:** The fact that people don’t understand the horrors around them can make their actions and reactions much creepier. For example, townsfolk might witness strange events, like objects moving, but they write it off as a bad dream or a fluke, or they might feel uneasy without knowing why. This creates a sense of incongruity, where something is wrong, but they don’t know what.

**Building Suspense:** As the players investigate, they can slowly reveal the horrifying truth to the citizens. This will give players a sense of discovery as they peel back the layers of reality. The idea that these people are living in a world that is not what it seems can heighten the players' sense of dread, as they are the only ones truly aware of the nightmare.

**Lovecraftian Isolation:** A core tenet of Lovecraftian horror is the idea that knowledge is dangerous. If the citizens are blissfully unaware, then the party can witness the citizens’ calm and their normalcy, which contrasts sharply with the horrors that lie beneath. The realization that the citizens’ lives are a lie can be very unsettling.

**Gradual Unraveling of Reality:** Since the citizens don’t know what’s going on, the party’s discoveries about the horrors become more impactful and meaningful. As they uncover hidden truths, the horrors will seem more vast, inevitable, and suffocating.

#### Cons:

**Limited Engagement:** If citizens are unaware of the horrors, it may be harder to engage them in the narrative. They might not know about the imminent threat the players are investigating, which can make it more difficult to create compelling story-driven motivations for NPCs. Players might find it challenging to get support from the community or find allies who fully grasp the stakes.

**Risk of Overwhelm:** If everything in the world feels disconnected and hidden, there might be a disconnect between the players and the world. The horrors may feel a bit more isolated, and the party could feel as though they're swimming in an ocean of dread with no one else in sight.

**Unrealized Danger:** While you could have subtle hints about the growing horrors, if no one is aware, it might take longer to hook players into the deeper, world-changing threats, especially if they’re investigating a mystery. The gradual realization might be too slow, potentially making the horror feel less urgent.

### Citizens Aware of the Horrors

In contrast, if the citizens of Barovia are aware of the horrors around them, it creates a much more tense and oppressive atmosphere. People live in a world where the horrors are part of their daily lives, and everyone has some inkling of the cosmic forces lurking in the shadows. The horror is no longer just about discovery; it’s about living in it, coping with it, and struggling to survive.

#### Pros:

**Paranoia and Dread:** If everyone knows that the world is full of horrors, but there’s no way to escape or stop them, this creates a palpable sense of existential dread. The citizens might have their own coping mechanisms, like trying to pretend everything is fine, but beneath the surface, they are frazzled, paranoid, and broken by the knowledge that nothing is ever truly safe.

**Rich Worldbuilding:** If the people are aware, they can reflect the atmosphere of the world in their actions, beliefs, and conversations. This allows you to build a lived-in world where the horrors are not just abstract concepts, but integral parts of society. Citizens might have superstitions, rituals, or even cultish behaviors to protect themselves from the unknown. They could acknowledge the darkness, and it would impact their interactions with the players.

**Moral Dilemmas:** Citizens who are aware of the horrors might choose to embrace them, worship them, or sacrifice to them in a desperate attempt to survive. There’s a possibility that some people collaborate with these forces, either out of fear or misguided hope. This opens up opportunities for ethical gray areas where players must decide whether to intervene in a society that might want to live under the influence of the horrors.

**More Urgency for the Players:** When the horrors are known and everyone is coping with them, the players’ discoveries will have more immediate impact. The stakes are higher because the citizens are aware of what’s at risk, and the party might feel more pressured to uncover the truth or stop the growing horrors before they consume everyone.

**Psychological Horror:** The awareness of the horrors can lead to collective trauma. Citizens can slowly unravel, developing obsessive rituals, paranoia, and insanity, which could form the backdrop for your campaign. You could have whole groups of people that are psychologically impacted by the constant exposure to unspeakable entities, creating haunting imagery for the players.

#### Cons:

**Overtly Dark Tone:** With everyone aware of the horrors, it might risk feeling a bit too bleak and hopeless. The awareness of the horrors can make it feel like there’s no way out, leading to a sense of resignation in the world. If everyone knows they’re trapped in this nightmare, it could strip the players of the excitement of discovery, making it harder to create a sense of progression or hope.

**Difficulty in Engagement:** If the people of Barovia are aware of the horrors, the players might struggle to convince others of the threat or find allies, especially if people have already come to terms with the horror or are complacent in their suffering. It could be harder to find characters who still have hope or will support the players’ goals if they think resistance is futile.

**Less Room for Mystery:** In a world where everyone knows about the horrors, the mystery element of your campaign might fade. Players won’t be uncovering unknown entities, and the discovery aspect will be more about how to deal with the known horrors, which can limit the thrill of exploration.
