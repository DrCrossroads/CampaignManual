In the 1920s, the average annual wage across all industries was about $1400 per year. $27 per week, $4 per day.

### Renamed standard D&D currency
- **Penny (cp)** = Copper Piece
- **Dime (sp)** = Silver Piece (10 Pennies)
- **Half Buck (ep)** = Electum Piece (5 Dimes)
- **Dollar (gp)** = Gold Piece (10 Dimes)
- **Sawbuck (pp)** = Platinum Piece (10 Dollars)
- **C-Note** = 10 Platinum Pieces (100 Dollars)

### **Pricing Considerations**
Given the **Great Depression influence**, everyday items should be **affordable** for the average person, while luxury items—like quality firearms, high-end vehicles, or arcane artifacts—should feel like **major investments**.

#### **Basic Cost Adjustments:**
- Common goods (food, clothing, lodging) should be cheaper, often costing just **pennies or dimes**.
- Firearms are **more widely available**, but better models should be **expensive** to reflect rarity and power.
- Magical and eldritch items are **black market or unique**, making them costly but still accessible.

#### **Example Price Adjustments:**
- **Lodging (cheap hotel/motel)** → 2-5 Dimes per night
- **Lodging (luxury hotel, speakeasy safehouse)** → 5-10 Dollars per night
- **Firearms (basic revolver or shotgun)** → 5-15 Dollars
- **Firearms (Tommy gun, sniper rifle)** → 50-100 Dollars
- **Ammunition (per box, 20-50 rounds)** → 5-10 Dimes
- **Basic Magic Trinket (cursed lighter, eerie pocket watch, minor talisman)** → 5-15 Dollars
- **Powerful Magic Artifact (a rare occult relic, eldritch firearm, ancient grimoire)** → 50-500 Dollars (depending on power level)

### **General Payment Guidelines per Mission**
- **Low-Level Missions (Levels 2-6)** → **2-6 Dollars per person**
    - Small-time detective work, minor occult investigations, roughing up informants, smuggling goods.
    - **Example:** Recovering a stolen relic for a desperate client → 10 Dollars split among the party.
    - They might also receive non-monetary rewards like favors, minor magic items, or information.

- **Mid-Level Missions (Levels 7-9)** → **10-20 Dollars per person**
    - Bigger jobs: working for crime families, major heists, deep occult research, hunting powerful monsters.
    - **Example:** Smuggling magical contraband for a gang boss → 15 Dollars each, plus a small artifact.

- **High-Level Missions (Levels 10+)** → **40+ Dollars per person**
    - High-stakes work: disrupting entire factions, assassinating key figures, uncovering eldritch horrors.
    - **Example:** Exposing a cult leader and surviving → 240 Dollars split among the party, plus rare occult knowledge.

### **Additional Rewards & Perks**
Instead of just cash, consider mixing in:
- **Connections & Favors** → The right people owe them, granting access to hidden markets, safe houses, or inside info.
- **Rare Gear** → Instead of straight cash, they might be gifted a rare firearm, enchanted relic, or special bullets.
- **Magic or Cursed Items** → As a “bonus,” they might acquire something supernatural (with unintended side effects).

##### Vending Machines
