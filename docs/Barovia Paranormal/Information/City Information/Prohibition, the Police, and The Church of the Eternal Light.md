## The Corrupt Church's Role

The Church in this version of Barovia is much more powerful and authoritarian than in the traditional Curse of Strahd setting. They use the Prohibition as a method to maintain control over the populace, tightening their grip on society while pretending to protect the people from moral decay.

### The Church of the Eternal Light
This is a church that officially opposes the consumption of alcohol and enforces a rigid moral code. Its dogma could be a twisted form of religious zealotry, focused on purity and the suppression of worldly desires (like alcohol). While on the surface, the Church may present itself as a protector of the people, it is secretly exploiting this moral panic for power and wealth.

#### The High Clerics
The higher-ups in the Church are actively profiting from the prohibition. They are secretly involved in bootlegging themselves, using their position to manipulate the local economy, while presenting a pious front to the people. Some clerics have their own illicit activities hidden behind their religious duties.

#### Enforcers of the Law
The Church’s enforcers are a faction of fanatical, zealous clerics who carry out the Prohibition by force. These enforcers are known as the "Purifiers" or "The Silent Ones." They patrol the streets, seeking out illegal alcohol and punishing offenders in brutal ways—whether through imprisonment, public punishment, or more horrific fates. Their presence adds a dark, religious tone to the Prohibition, making it not just about the law but about divine retribution.

## The Mafia and the Bootlegging Business

The Mafia families find themselves directly at odds with the Church's enforcement of Prohibition. As the Church cracks down on alcohol, the Mafia sees an opportunity to exploit the situation and make a significant profit by supplying Barovia with illegal alcohol.

### Bootlegging Syndicates
The Mafia families each have different approaches to bootlegging. Some operate openly, while others run covert, underground speakeasies, hidden behind layers of deception. Thereare multiple factions—each competing for control of Barovia’s alcohol trade. This adds an extra layer of tension as these families fight not only the Church’s enforcers but also each other.

### Rivalries
Mafia families might be willing to pay bribes to Church officials or offer favors in exchange for protection from the Purifiers. Conversely, some factions might use alcohol as leverage to control key members of the Church, leading to tense negotiations, blackmail, and political intrigue. At the same time, Mafia members could be deeply superstitious, seeking out occult knowledge to ensure their rise to power, possibly getting involved with dark rituals and alliances with more malevolent forces.

### The Shadow War
The war between the Mafia and the Church's enforcers feels like a shadow conflict—violent and subtle, fought in the back alleys, hidden rooms, and places of worship. Players might get caught in the crossfire between these two factions. Whether they are trying to investigate the Church's corruption or looking to assist one of the Mafia families, the party will find themselves constantly navigating a world of moral ambiguity.

## Incorporating the Prohibition into Story Arcs

The Prohibition could become a significant backdrop or even a central theme in the campaign. Here are a few potential story arcs that tie in with the Prohibition, the Church, and the Mafia:

### Investigation into the Church’s Corruption
The party could be hired (or perhaps forced) to investigate corruption within the Church. They might uncover evidence of the Church's secret dealings in the bootlegging trade. As they delve deeper, they might discover that some of the higher-ups in the Church are tied to more sinister forces, possibly even Strahd’s own machinations. The investigation will take them into dangerous political waters as they begin to uncover dark secrets about the Church’s origins and its involvement with the undead.

### The Speakeasy Network
A local Mafia family might contact the party to find out who’s responsible for destroying their speakeasy or to hunt down informants who have been tipping off the Church. This could lead to a series of missions where the party has to infiltrate speakeasies, attend illicit gatherings, and investigate how the Purifiers are cracking down on the alcohol trade.

### Underground Alcohol
As a party, they could be hired by the Mafia to protect or transport shipments of alcohol through the dangerous, Purifier-infested streets. Along the way, they might run into unexpected obstacles: rival Mafia families, Purifiers on patrol, and possibly even supernatural creatures attracted to the chaos and dark energy surrounding the prohibition. The party might need to confront their own morality as they decide whether or not to support an illicit trade that’s linked to crime and corruption.

### The Church's New "Divine" Agenda
As the Prohibition tightens, the Church could start portraying the act of drinking as a sin that ties people to Strahd's dark influence. They may even use alcohol-related offenses as an excuse to drag more citizens into the church, where they are brainwashed or "purified." The players could uncover that the Church’s motives go beyond prohibition—it might be manipulating the town’s fear and piety for its own gain, all to serve Strahd’s larger goals. The Purifiers might even try to forcibly convert people by making them abstain from alcohol and other perceived vices—possibly leading to cult-like activities.

### A Brewing Underground Movement
With the rise of Prohibition, a movement for the freedom to drink could start to form. A ragtag group of revolutionaries, disgruntled citizens, and even former members of the Church who’ve turned on it might organize a rebellion. The players might find themselves embroiled in a conflict between the Church’s Purifiers and the rebellious underground, with the final goal being the overthrow of the Church’s control over alcohol.

## World-Building Considerations

### Black Market
The black market for alcohol is rife with potential for adventure. If the players need to find a supplier for illicit goods, they may come across interesting characters—former brewers, smugglers, or even criminals who have turned to more occult practices in their search for rare and forbidden alcohol (some of which could be cursed or magically potent).

### Speakeasy Culture
These hidden clubs are places of revelry, but also places where the cults of the undead gather, and the lines between fun and danger blur. The players might find themselves at the intersection of decadent parties and horrifying occult rituals, where the stakes are raised in the pursuit of forbidden pleasure.

### Oppressive Atmosphere
As Prohibition fuels the corrupt church and criminal organizations, the citizens of Barovia may begin to lose hope. The Church’s presence and the criminal underworld will intensify the atmosphere of fear and distrust. Players will witness this in the eyes of the common folk—the fear of being punished for drinking, the constant threat of gang violence, and the suffocating control of the Church.

## Important NPCs

#### Father Jarek
A charismatic but ruthless cleric who leads the Purifiers. He believes he is doing the work of Strahd by controlling the vices of the people. His secret dealings with the Mafia are unknown to most, and he uses the Prohibition as a way to secure more power for the Church and himself.

#### Vito Moretti
A charming but dangerous mafia boss who controls a large part of the alcohol trade in Barovia. He sees the Church as a rival to his empire and will do whatever it takes to keep the Prohibition from hindering his business.

#### Amelia Tretova
A rebellious journalist or former member of the Church who has uncovered its secret dealings. She might secretly seek out the party to help her expose the Church’s corruption and bring down Father Jarek’s regime.

## The Relationship Between Clerics and Cops

### The Clerics as the Law
The Church is the dominant religious institution in Barovia and its clerics are actively enforcing Prohibition. The law enforcement in Barovia might be heavily influenced or even controlled by the Church. The Church has enforcers, called "Purifiers" (as mentioned earlier) who work in tandem with the local police. The clerics essentially act as both a spiritual authority and a law enforcement agency, and they have the power to override local cops if needed.

### Purifiers
A specialized division of zealous clerics who enforce not only Prohibition but also the Church’s moral law. These clerics work closely with the police, but they operate under their own jurisdiction, often bypassing local laws in favor of divine law.

### Hierarchy
Higher-ranking clerics (like priests or bishops) have the ear of the local authorities (police chiefs or sheriffs), but they also subvert local law enforcement authority, ordering them around or bypassing them to enforce Church doctrines. In essence, they consider themselves to be above or parallel to the cops, enforcing their vision of order and purity.

### Cops as Overwhelmed or Resentful
Alternatively, several law enforcement officers see the Church’s influence as a thorn in their side—a rival power they can’t control. While the police are still responsible for general law and order, these small groups of cops resent the Church’s heavy hand in local affairs. Police officers view clerics as intruders in their jurisdiction, causing tension between the two groups. Some cops might be sympathetic to the people and see the Church's actions as unjust, while others are be complicit, silently obeying the Church’s orders because they fear reprisal or prefer the power they gain by working with the Church.

### Corruption
Some officers are on the take, accepting bribes from the Church or the Mafia to look the other way during raids, letting smugglers slip through, or overlooking illegal drinking. Others are more idealistic, trying to hold their ground but feeling increasingly powerless in the face of the Church’s influence.

## Potential Conflicts Between Clerics and Cops

### Moral and Ideological Conflicts
The clerics view themselves as the moral backbone of Barovia, enforcing their doctrine, and the police view themselves as protectors of the law and citizens, there could be significant philosophical clashes between the two factions.

Clerics push for purification, viewing alcohol and vice as dangerous moral blights that need to be eradicated for the greater good. They might see any police resistance or corruption as a moral failure or a sign of weakness.

Police, especially the more pragmatic officers, see the clerics as overstepping, and some distrust their motivations. If they view the Church as a threat to personal freedoms or civil rights, they could openly or subtly rebel against their increasing control, leading to a battle for influence over the city.

#### **The Church of the Eternal Light: Ideals and Doctrine**

The **Church of the Eternal Light** presents itself as a beacon of purity, morality, and divine guidance in the dark world of Barovia. However, beneath its pious exterior lies a corrupt institution that manipulates faith to control the populace, suppress vices, and accumulate power.

### Enforcement of Prohibition
Enforcement of Prohibition causes significant friction. The cops feel that enforcing Prohibition is a waste of resources, and there are undercover resistances where officers secretly participate in the bootlegging trade, allowing alcohol to flow in certain parts of the city.

Tension will rise if the Church orders raids, forcing the police to act against their will. This will create moral dilemmas for characters who are police officers or have connections with law enforcement. In a desperate act of defiance, they might allow a bootlegging operation to continue to avoid an uncomfortable confrontation with the Church's zealots.

### Cultural Divide
The clerics see the police as secular and morally compromised—working for the world and mafias' power rather than divine authority. Conversely, the police view the clerics as fanatics or corrupt religious zealots who use their religious authority as a tool of oppression. This cultural divide between the "secular" police force and the "divine" clerics will provide some fascinating interpersonal drama, especially if the players are caught between the two factions.

## Possible Encounters and Campaign Hooks

### Investigating Corruption
The party may be hired by the police or a high-ranking government official to investigate corruption within the Church (i.e., clerics profiting off Prohibition). As they get deeper into the investigation, they may uncover secret deals with the Mafia, illicit alcohol trade, and darker occult practices.

They could be tasked with investigating whether the Church has bought off certain cops, or whether it’s secretly complicit in the illegal activities. This will create moral quandaries, as they could end up assisting the corrupt police force in their bid to take down the Church—or be forced to choose a side.

### Raids and Arrests
If the clerics push for a large raid on a bootlegging operation or attempt to shut down a speakeasy (perhaps a major plot point), the police might be ordered to assist, which will lead to a major conflict. The party may be involved in the operation to either prevent it or help execute it, facing both the Purifiers and hostile police.

Alternatively, the players may be accused of being part of a bootlegging ring, forcing them to outwit or escape from clergy-enforced arrests or police entanglements. They could attempt to fight back, bribe officials, or go on the run.

### Cops in the Mafia’s Pocket
Some cops secretly work for the Mafia, either by being bribed to ignore bootlegging activities or to pass information about Church activities. If the party is investigating either the Mafia or the Church, they may encounter police who are more sympathetic to criminal enterprises, or who try to mislead them or divert their attention from the true corruption.

The players may have an encounter where a corrupt cop tries to lead them into a trap or sabotages their investigation to protect the Mafia.

### Shared Adversaries
There may be moments where both the Church and the police are working together, perhaps for a larger political agenda or a shared goal (such as rooting out dangerous cults or disbanding a criminal syndicate). The players may be forced to decide where their loyalties lie—will they continue to oppose both factions or try to exploit the friction between them to their advantage?

## NPCs: Key Law Enforcement Figures

#### Inspector Viktor Draeg
The head of Barovia’s police force, Viktor is a no-nonsense cop who despises the Church’s interference in his work. He may secretly be a drinker or have ties to the Mafia and might be willing to pay the party for information that could help him undermine the Church’s power. If they get too close to the truth, however, he might try to frame them for a crime.

#### Father Adelric
A high-ranking cleric who heads the Purifiers. He is stern, cold, and ruthless in his enforcement of Prohibition. He has a significant influence over the police force and might offer them bribes or threats to maintain the Church’s authority. He believes his divine mandate justifies any actions, including forcible removal of officers who don’t comply with Church orders.

#### Officer Nina Volkov
A member of the police force who is deeply conflicted about her duties. She believes in the law but is growing more uncomfortable with the Church’s increasing control. She might approach the players for help in investigating corruption or gathering information about the Church’s dealings.
