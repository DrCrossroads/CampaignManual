### **Eldritch Blades** _(Twin Longswords, Legendary, Requires Attunement by a Non-Good Creature)_

These **blackened, rune-inscribed blades** hum with an eerie resonance, their edges flickering between reality and something far worse. The whispers of those slain by these swords echo faintly when drawn.

#### **Properties:**
- **Eldritch Edge.** The Eldritch Blades are **+2 magical weapons**. They deal **an additional 2d8 psychic damage** on a hit.
- **Finesse & Dual Wielding.** If attuned, you can wield both swords **without the Dual Wielder feat**. While dual-wielding these blades, you gain **advantage on attacks against frightened or charmed creatures**.
- **Lingering Agony.** A creature hit by the Eldritch Blades **cannot regain hit points** until the start of its next turn.

#### **Curse: Whispers of the Forsaken**
While attuned, the wielder hears **the endless whispers of Rahadin’s victims**, clawing at their mind. These voices create the following effects:
- **Eldritch Nightmares.** The wielder cannot benefit from a **long rest** unless they succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** each night. On a failure, they gain **one level of exhaustion** and experience horrific dreams of **a vast, writhing entity** in the void.
- **Compulsion to Slaughter.** If the wielder reduces a creature to 0 hit points, they must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or be **forced to use their next action to attack another living creature** within range. If no creatures are available, the wielder **lashes out at their own reflection or shadow**, taking **2d8 psychic damage**.
- **Mark of the Eldritch Knight.** While wielding the blades, the wielder **cannot enter holy ground** without suffering **4d10 radiant damage**. Clerics and paladins can sense their **corruption**, treating them with hostility.

#### **Awakening the True Horror** _(Optional, DM’s Choice)_
If the blades are wielded in **Rahadin’s presence** or **within Castle Ravenloft**, they may awaken their **true nature**, forming into **sentient, writhing blades** that seek to consume their wielder entirely. The wielder must succeed on a **DC 18 Charisma saving throw** or have their soul **suppressed**, becoming an extension of the Elder God’s will for 1d6 hours.
