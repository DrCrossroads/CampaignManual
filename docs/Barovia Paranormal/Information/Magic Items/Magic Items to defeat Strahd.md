## **The Sun Blade (Sable Edge)**

_"A blade that flickers between worlds, existing in multiple realities at once. To wield it is to hold a sliver of the infinite."_

### **Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by a creature of strong will)**

The Sun Blade, now called **Sable Edge**, is **not a true sword**, but rather a **fracture in reality**, shaped into the form of a weapon. It flickers in and out of existence, phasing between planes.

### **Properties:**

- **Shifting Reality.** The blade is **insubstantial**, passing harmlessly through nonliving matter while striking with full force against creatures. The wielder **ignores resistance to slashing damage** and treats **immunities as resistances**.
- **Eldritch Bane.** When used against **aberrations, undead, and creatures tainted by the Elder God**, the blade glows with an eerie, ultraviolet radiance, dealing an extra **2d10 psychic damage** on a hit.
- **Phase Cutter.** As a **bonus action**, the wielder can **shift the sword into another reality**, causing the blade to become **invisible and intangible** for 1 minute. While in this state, **the next melee attack made with the blade has advantage and deals an additional 4d6 force damage.**
- **Shatter the Veil (1/day).** The wielder can plunge the sword into the fabric of reality itself. **As an action**, they make a single melee attack against a creature. On a hit, the target must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or be **phased into an alternate, non-Euclidean space**, rendering them **incapacitated and blinded** for 1 minute. They repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.

> _"This blade does not burn with the light of the sun. It instead carves the darkness away, peeling back layers of existence."_

## **The Tome of Strahd (The Book of Forgotten Names)**

_"A chronicle not just of Strahd, but of all who have been consumed by the Elder God. Their memories whisper from its pages, eager to be heard."_

### **Wondrous Item, legendary**

The Tome of Strahd has been **corrupted by something older than Strahd himself**. It is no longer a simple vampire’s diary but a **cursed manuscript that records the lives of those lost to the mist**. The book **rewrites itself in real time**, adding entries from souls devoured by the Elder God.

### **Properties:**

- **Bound Knowledge.** When studied for **8 hours**, the tome grants cryptic insight into **Strahd’s weaknesses, lair, and past mistakes**. The reader gains **advantage on Insight, Investigation, and Religion checks related to Strahd and the Elder God.**
- **The Forsaken Voices.** The tome contains the spirits of **those who perished in the mists**. As an **action**, the wielder may invoke the book’s power, forcing **all aberrations, undead, and extraplanar entities within 30 feet** to make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or suffer **5d8 psychic damage and be stunned until the end of their next turn.**
- **Echoes of the Devoured.** When holding the book, the wielder can **hear whispers** from its pages, offering them visions of possible futures. Once per long rest, they can choose to **reroll any failed ability check, attack roll, or saving throw**. However, they must then **succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or have their mind briefly pulled into the depths of the book**, suffering **3d6 psychic damage** and gaining a **short-term madness** effect.

> _"Do not trust the book. It tells you what you wish to know, but at a cost. The voices inside hunger for your name to be written next."_

## **The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (The Black Star Pendant)**

_"A shattered fragment of something divine, reforged into a weapon against the void."_

### **Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of strong will)**

The Holy Symbol has changed over the centuries. It is now known as the **Black Star Pendant**, a **jagged, onyx-black amulet veined with golden cracks**, as if it is struggling to contain the remnants of divine light. Though it still channels the power of the divine, it also holds within it the **last light of a dead star**, giving it an eerie, radiant presence.

### **Properties:**

- **Abyssal Banishment.** As an **action**, the wielder can hold the pendant aloft and unleash a pulse of black-and-gold light. Any **aberration or undead within 30 feet** must make a **DC 19 Charisma saving throw** or be **banished for 1 minute to a realm outside time and space.** If the creature is reduced to 0 HP while banished, it is **erased from existence**.
- **Raven’s Refuge.** While attuned to the pendant, the wielder can **cast Protection from Evil and Good at will**, without expending a spell slot.
- **Tears of the Elder Star (1/day).** The pendant channels **pure stellar energy**, burning away unnatural creatures. As an action, the wielder can cause it to flare, forcing all **aberrations, undead, and fiends within 60 feet** to make a **DC 19 Constitution saving throw**. On a failure, they take **6d10 radiant damage** and are **blinded for 1 minute**. On a success, they take half damage and are not blinded.
- **Flickering Salvation.** The pendant’s power **disrupts death itself**. When the wielder or an ally within **10 feet** would be **reduced to 0 HP**, the pendant flares **once per long rest**, instead **leaving the creature at 1 HP and teleporting them up to 30 feet away**.

> _"They say the light of the gods has died. This is what remains—shattered, imperfect, but still burning."_

### **Final Thoughts**

- The **Sable Edge** shifts between realities, serving as the **ultimate weapon against eldritch horrors**.
- The **Book of Forgotten Names** grants knowledge but is itself **corrupted by the Elder God**.
- The **Black Star Pendant** is a **fragment of celestial power**, a dying light repurposed to hold back the darkness.
