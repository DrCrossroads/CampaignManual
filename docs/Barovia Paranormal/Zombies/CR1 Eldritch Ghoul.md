**Eldritch Presence.** The Eldritch Ghoul exudes a faint aura of madness that unsettles those who approach it. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the Ghoul must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened until the start of its next turn.

**Horrific Mutation.** The Ghoul’s body is a distorted parody of humanoid form, with extra limbs, flickering appendages, or unsettlingly disjointed movement. As a result, it can use its claws or bite attack from unexpected angles, increasing its attack range by 5 feet.

**Telepathic Whisper.** The Ghoul can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or hear maddening whispers that attempt to warp their sanity. A creature that fails the save has disadvantage on its next attack roll or saving throw.

**Eldritch Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (2d6 + 1) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be afflicted with the _Frightened_ condition for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Twisted Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is not a creature of the undead type, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Cosmic Dread (Recharge 5–6).** The Ghoul can channel the terrifying knowledge of the cosmos in a pulse of malevolent energy. All creatures within a 15-foot radius of the Ghoul must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 round. On a successful save, creatures take half damage and are not stunned.

**Description:**

The Eldritch Ghoul is a twisted version of the traditional undead, warped by cosmic forces. Its eyes gleam with an unnatural glow, and its form is not fully bound by the laws of space and time. It may appear as though its body is flickering between dimensions, or it could have several arms or legs where none should be. The Ghoul's presence can distort reality itself, making it difficult for the minds of those nearby to comprehend what they’re seeing.

This creature is the manifestation of horrors from beyond the stars, and its mere proximity makes mortals question their own sanity.

- **Eldritch Presence** is more unsettling, reflecting the psychic pressure of such creatures and causing fear in those nearby, a common theme in cosmic horror.
- The **Horrific Mutation** gives it a non-traditional, unnatural form that can confuse and disturb the players.
