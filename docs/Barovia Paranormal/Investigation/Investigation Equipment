### **1. Ætheric Flux Indicator**

➡ _A handcrafted, brass-and-glass device with vacuum tubes and a rotating needle. Reacts to supernatural and eldritch distortions in reality._

- **Function:** Detects areas of high eldritch or spectral energy.
- **How It Works:**
    - A small antenna and vacuum tube pick up fluctuations in _Ætheric energy_ (a pseudo-scientific explanation for supernatural forces).
    - The needle quivers near unnatural presences, and the device emits a faint hum that rises in pitch as it nears a strong source.
    - Can be **overloaded** if exposed to too much power, causing a brief static shock to the holder.
- **Skill Check:** _Arcana (DC 12-16)_ to interpret subtle shifts.

🔹 _Example Application:_

- The Indicator’s needle **spins wildly** near a hidden sigil, revealing the strongest point of corruption.
- Holding it up in the dining room causes it to _suddenly go silent_, implying an entity is **suppressing** its function.

- **New Feature:** The indicator now changes **color or frequency** depending on the nature of the disturbance.
