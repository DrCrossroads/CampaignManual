### **The Elder God: Origins and Influence**

1. **The Ancient Entity**: The Elder God is an ancient, malevolent being, older than time itself. It predates even [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]’s arrival in Barovia and has long been trapped in the land, bound by forces far beyond mortal understanding. This god is not one of the known deities worshipped in Barovia, but rather a force of nature—an entity of dreams, madness, and entropy. Its power is subtle but vast, leaking into the world through cracks in reality, particularly in dreams and nightmares. It feeds on the fear, suffering, and despair of the trapped souls within Barovia, growing stronger the more the inhabitants lose their hope.
2. **The Dream-World and Reality**: The Elder God’s power manifests primarily through dreams. It is able to influence the dream realm, which overlaps with the waking world, creating distortions and blending the two realms together. When people sleep in Barovia, they are vulnerable to its whispers, dreams of madness, and visions of cosmic horror. The Elder God’s influence causes Barovia to be a land of endless despair, where hope seems as illusory as the fleeting light of dawn. The Dreamwalkers, especially [[_The Vistani]], serve as conduits for the Elder God’s power, gathering dreams, manipulating destinies, and guiding events toward their ultimate goal of freeing their master.
3. **Whispers of Liberation**: The Elder God seeks freedom, but not in the typical sense. It desires to break free from the shackles that bind it in Barovia, though this would result in untold chaos in the world. Its release would unravel reality itself, causing the collapse of all that exists. Strahd, however, holds the key to the Elder God’s release. His own curse—his immortality and power over the land—are tied to the Elder God’s imprisonment. Strahd’s continued dominance over Barovia is the only thing keeping the Elder God from awakening fully. However, Strahd has no true understanding of this connection, only that his power is absolute within Barovia, and he is unwilling to lose it.
4. **The Dreamwalker’s True Purpose**: The Vistani Dreamwalkers are not just pawns in Strahd’s game; they are agents of the Elder God. Their primary mission is to weaken Strahd’s control over Barovia and to sow chaos within the land. While Strahd may see the Vistani as allies, they secretly manipulate him, guiding him toward actions that will unknowingly open the gates for the Elder God’s return. They twist the dreams of key individuals in Barovia, influencing their actions and dreams in ways that unknowingly advance the Elder God’s cause. They may also use Strahd’s desire for control to distract him from the true horror that lurks in the dark corners of Barovia.

### **Strahd's Role in the Elder God’s Scheme**

1. **Strahd as the Prison Warden**: Strahd Von Zarovich is both the ruler and the jailor of Barovia, keeping the land locked in a perpetual cycle of death and suffering. His immortality, granted by a dark pact with the Elder God or some other unknown force, serves as a mechanism to trap the Elder God in the land. The curse of the land—and of Strahd’s existence—is directly tied to the Elder God. Strahd’s need for control and dominance is not just a personal obsession, but also a response to the prison-like nature of his existence. He has convinced himself that he is the master of Barovia, but in truth, he is simply its caretaker, maintaining the illusion of power while keeping the Elder God chained.
2. **The Flawed King**: Strahd’s obsession with immortality, power, and control blinds him to the true nature of his situation. He believes that he is the master of Barovia, that his rule is unchallenged, and that he alone controls the fate of his domain. This arrogance and pride make him vulnerable. The Elder God’s influence gradually undermines Strahd’s psyche, causing him to become more erratic, paranoid, and vengeful. Strahd’s actions—his pursuit of Tatyana (his lost love), his obsession with defeating enemies, his desire to create an heir—are all tied to the whisperings of the Elder God. The Eldritch being feeds off his desires, twisting them into something darker and more destructive.
3. **Strahd’s Hidden Knowledge**: There are fragments of truth that Strahd has unearthed, but these pieces are scattered and shrouded in confusion. Through his centuries of rule, Strahd has uncovered glimpses of the Elder God’s influence, but he does not fully comprehend it. He believes that the key to his salvation—or perhaps his ultimate victory—lies in controlling the domain and finding a way to break free from the land’s grip. However, the more he seeks to control, the more the Elder God strengthens its hold over him. Strahd’s obsession with Tatyana, whom he believes is the reincarnation of his lost love, could also be a manipulation of the Elder God to ensure that Strahd remains distracted and emotionally unstable.
4. **A Fragile Alliance**: While Strahd may rely on the Vistani for information, guidance, and subtle influence over the people of Barovia, he is unaware of their true agenda. His relationship with them is one of mutual use: the Vistani manipulate him through dreams and prophecies, while Strahd uses their influence to maintain control over the land. He believes that the Vistani serve his interests, but they are, in fact, the true architects of his eventual downfall. The Elder God uses Strahd’s need for dominance and control to break him, planting seeds of doubt, mistrust, and desperation in the vampire lord’s heart.

### **Interactions Between Strahd and the Elder God’s Cults**

- **The Cult of the Elder God**: The various cults and factions that worship the Elder God in Barovia (such as the Dreamwalkers and the mysterious entities in the shadows) serve their dark master by subtly undermining Strahd’s control over Barovia. These cults operate under the belief that Strahd is an obstacle to the Elder God’s freedom, and their ultimate goal is to see Strahd fall, whether through manipulation, chaos, or a more direct confrontation.
- **The Struggle for Power**: Strahd's obsession with ruling Barovia could lead him to make deals with other powerful factions or entities, further complicating the power struggle within Barovia. As the Vistani and other agents of the Elder God whisper in his ear, Strahd’s decisions grow more erratic. However, Strahd is not entirely ignorant of the threat the Elder God represents. He may become aware that the same force he is bound to keep locked away is beginning to seep into his world through the cracks in the fabric of reality.

---

### **Conclusion: The Inescapable Cycle**

Strahd is both the villain and a tragic figure. He is caught in a cycle that he cannot break—driven by his own desires for power, immortality, and control, yet bound by a dark force that is far beyond his understanding. The Elder God, a being of infinite malice, whispers through the dreamworld and manipulates the events in Barovia, ultimately using Strahd as a tool for its own release.

This dynamic can create a setting where the characters are caught between Strahd’s tyranny and the looming, incomprehensible horrors of the Elder God, with the Vistani Dreamwalkers serving as both pawns and agents in the cosmic struggle between these forces.

### Battle Phases

#### Phase 1: Awakening Kth'Vulgaroth
- The temple begins **shaking violently** as the Elder God stirs.
- Water **seeps through the walls**, slowly beginning to flood the lower levels.
- Kth'Vulgaroth emerges from the depths of the temple.
- The **portal to the stars opens above**, swirling with incomprehensible visions of the void.

**Lair Actions Phase 1**

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Kth'Vulgaroth can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

1. **Flooding Tides** – Water rushes in, **flooding the lowest floor**. Anyone in the flooded area must make a **DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check** or be pulled underwater and start drowning.
2. **Mind Twist.** Kth'Vulgaroth distorts reality, causing all creatures within 120 feet to experience fragmented, maddening visions. Each creature must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and become paralyzed until the start of its next turn.
3. **Dark Submersion.** A deep fog of oily darkness spreads across the lair, reducing visibility to 10 feet. Any creature within the fog that starts its turn there must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and be blinded until the end of its next turn.

#### Phase 2: The Flood Rises
**Monster HP 150**
- The temple **continues flooding**, forcing the party **to move to higher ground**.
- The **portal widens**, and a **massive tentacled cosmic entity** begins pulling itself through.
- Kth'Vulgaroth **grows stronger**, absorbing the power of the portal.

**Lair Actions Phase 2

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the following lair actions replace those from Phase 1:

- **The Void Beckons** – The portal exerts a powerful pull. Every creature must make a **DC 17 Strength save** or be **pulled 10 feet toward the portal**. If they are **within 15 feet**, they must succeed on a second save or be **grappled by the entity's tentacle**.
- **Tidal Surge** – A massive wave crashes through the temple, knocking prone all creatures who fail a **DC 18 Dexterity save** and dealing **4d8 bludgeoning damage**.
- **Warped Reality** – Kth'Vulgaroth **bends time and space**. A random player experiences **1 of 3 effects**:
    - (1) **A past self appears and mimics their actions**, causing their next attack to be made at **disadvantage**.
    - (2) **They see a vision of their death**, taking **4d6 psychic damage** and becoming **frightened** until the end of their next turn.
    - (3) **Their body warps**, causing them to teleport **30 feet in a random direction**.

#### Phase 3: The Last Stand
**Monster HP 60**
- The **temple is almost entirely underwater**. The final battle takes place in the **highest chamber**, where only a few platforms remain above water.
- The **portal is nearly fully open**, and the cosmic horror **is halfway through**.
- Kth'Vulgaroth **goes into a final frenzy**, desperate to be free.

**Lair Actions Phase 3

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the following lair actions replace those from Phase 2:

- **Abyssal Gravity** – The gravity in the room **fluctuates wildly**. Players must make a **DC 19 Constitution save** or be thrown **30 feet upward**, taking **fall damage** if they hit the ceiling.
- **Tentacles of the Void** – **1d4 massive tentacles** burst through the portal, attacking randomly. Each tentacle has AC 16 and **50 HP**; destroying them weakens the entity.
- **Final Pull** – The portal pulses with power, **sucking in everything nearby**. Every creature must make a **DC 20 Strength save** or be pulled **directly toward the portal**. If they fail by **5 or more**, they are sucked in, vanishing forever.
****

### **Winning the Battle**

- **Defeating Kth'Vulgaroth** causes the portal to **implode**, sending out a massive shockwave that **crushes** the temple and **stabilizes reality**.
- The party has **mere moments** to escape before the temple collapses completely.

### **Alternative Outcome – Failing to Close the Portal**

- If the party **fails to stop Kth'Vulgaroth in time**, the **cosmic horror fully emerges**. The world as they know it is **devoured**, and Barovia becomes an extension of the **Elder God's realm**—a reality of endless, nightmarish horrors.
****

**Additional Notes for Campaign:**

- **Strahd’s Role:** Strahd serves as the "warden" of the lake, keeping the horrors at bay and preventing Kth'Vulgaroth’s influence from spreading. His actions as a vampire lord are motivated by fear and his twisted sense of duty. He might be a tragic villain who truly believes he's keeping Barovia safe from annihilation, even if his methods are oppressive and destructive.
- **The Underwater Temple:** The Amber Temple, in your narrative, could be the final place where the players learn more about Kth'Vulgaroth and its true nature. It was built as a prison by ancient sorcerers who once fought against the god. Strange rites, submerged ruins, and underwater monsters can make this a chilling locale where the players must face their own fears.
- **After Strahd’s Defeat:** Once Strahd is defeated, Kth'Vulgaroth stirs fully, causing even more Lovecraftian horrors to infest Barovia. The players now face a world rapidly descending into madness, with terrifying creatures like Deep Ones and other abyssal beings coming from the water.
