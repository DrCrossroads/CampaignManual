**Pack Tactics**: The Swarm has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the Swarm's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**Cursed Filth**: The rats that make up this swarm are tainted by a dark force—either ancient magic or a supernatural infection. Any creature that comes within 5 feet of the Swarm must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a debilitating illness. On a failed save, the creature suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A creature that becomes infected with this illness shows visible signs of the disease: fevered skin, sores, and an unnatural pallor.

**Undead Frenzy**: When the Swarm is reduced to half its hit points or fewer, its movements become erratic, and the rats become more desperate. The Swarm gains a bonus to its speed, increasing to 40 feet, and deals an additional 2 (1d4) necrotic damage with its **Bite** attack.

**Bite**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. _Hit_: 7 (2d6) piercing damage, or 8 (3d6) piercing damage if the swarm is within 5 feet of a creature infected by the Cursed Filth.

**Vermin Infestation** (Recharge 5-6): The Swarm sends forth an explosive burst of rats, creating a brief but terrifying burst of vermin that scurries over its enemies. Each creature within 15 feet of the Swarm must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) piercing damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half as much damage and is not poisoned.

**Flavor and Setting Adjustments**

- **Appearance**: The **Swarm of Cursed Vermin** consists of filthy, mangy rats that scuttle in unnerving, unnatural swarms. Their fur is matted and slick with what appears to be either decay or some type of dark, magical ichor. Their eyes are milky white or glowing faintly, evidence of their corruption by some deeper force—likely tied to the creeping death that’s overtaken the city. These rats are not normal animals, but reflections of a dying, cursed world.

- **Cursed Nature**: The rats are connected to an ancient malady or curse—a plague that is either supernatural in origin or a result of Strahd’s sinister magic. Their bites do more than just infect with disease; they carry the mark of something much darker, perhaps tied to some forgotten horror of the 1920s or a long-lost city curse. They could be tied to a forgotten horror from the city's past, unleashed after some supernatural event, such as the disturbing rise of the undead or a cult's experiments gone wrong.

- **Setting Fit**: In a city near the ocean, especially one touched by supernatural forces, these rats could be seen as part of a larger infestation problem. Perhaps they came from the city’s sewers, from the shipyards, or from a long-abandoned hospital where terrible experiments were conducted. The rats scurrying along dark alleys or beneath the floors of the city’s decaying buildings could be ominous reminders of the city’s forgotten past. They might be drawn to the corruption of the land or to the blood of the living, feeding on what little vitality remains.

**Narrative Potential**

The **Swarm of Cursed Vermin** could be encountered in the city’s darker corners, in the filth of abandoned buildings, or even near locations with tragic histories. These swarms could be drawn to places where death or despair lingers, such as a crime scene left untouched for years, the aftermath of a brutal murder, or the decaying remains of an industrial disaster. The rats could also be a symptom of a larger, more horrifying presence, perhaps the first warning that something much darker is lurking beneath the city’s crumbling facade.
