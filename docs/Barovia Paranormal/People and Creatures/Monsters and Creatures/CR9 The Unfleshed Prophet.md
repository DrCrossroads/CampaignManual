_Once human, this being has become something more—a wretched, towering figure of **pulsing veins and exposed muscle**, eyes that see beyond time, and a voice that compels the weak-willed to **worship or perish**._

### **Traits**

**Prophet’s Word.** When a creature **within 30 feet** of the Unfleshed Prophet **casts a spell, attacks, or takes an action**, it must make a **DC 17 Charisma saving throw** or be **forced to kneel (prone) and take no action this turn** as its mind is overwhelmed by the Prophet’s voice. Creatures immune to being charmed are unaffected.

**Visions of the End.** When a creature **first sees the Prophet**, it must succeed on a **DC 17 Intelligence saving throw** or take **22 (4d10) psychic damage** and become **frightened for 1 minute**. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

**Bloodied Revelation.** When the Prophet drops below **half HP (76 HP or lower)**, it **gains another action per turn** as its body **twists and reshapes**, revealing **dozens of screaming faces beneath its flesh**.

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** The Prophet makes **three attacks**: one **Claw**, one **Gaze of Ruin**, and one use of **Chains of Worship**.

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage. If the target is **grappled**, this attack **automatically hits**.

**Gaze of Ruin.** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +10 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature.  
_Hit:_ 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and the target is **blinded for 1 minute** (DC 17 Constitution save ends).

**Chains of Worship (Recharge 5-6).** The Prophet **extends spectral tendrils** toward up to **three creatures within 30 feet**. Each must make a **DC 17 Charisma saving throw** or be **charmed for 1 minute**. Charmed creatures will **willingly kneel before the Prophet** and take **no hostile actions** unless they take damage.

**Unmake Reality (1/Day).** The Prophet **tears at the fabric of space**, creating an **area of warping void** in a **20-foot radius** centered on itself for 1 minute.

- Any creature that **enters or starts its turn** in the area must make a **DC 17 Constitution saving throw**, taking **27 (6d8) force damage** on a failed save, or half on a success.
- The area is considered **difficult terrain**, and **spells cast within it have a 50% chance to fail**.

### **Tactics & Flavor**

- The Unfleshed Prophet **seeks followers, not just victims**. It whispers **prophecies of doom**, luring cultists and broken minds.
- It may be **a former high priest**, twisted into an **aberrant messiah**.
- If **slain**, it **collapses into a mass of rotting, shifting flesh**, leaving behind **a cryptic, self-etched prophecy written in blood**.
