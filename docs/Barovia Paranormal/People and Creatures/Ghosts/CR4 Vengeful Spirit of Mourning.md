**Incorporeal Movement**: The Vengeful Spirit can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Mournful Presence**: The ghost carries with it the mourning sounds of the city—sad wails of loss, the flutter of old photographs, and the hushed whispers of broken promises. All creatures within 30 feet of the Vengeful Spirit must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be haunted by vivid, nightmarish memories. A creature that fails its saving throw has disadvantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw are immune to this effect for 24 hours.

**Echoes of the Forgotten**: When the Vengeful Spirit is within 5 feet of a creature, it can speak to them in faint, distorted whispers. A creature that hears these whispers must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become haunted by fragments of forgotten memories, forcing them to spend their next turn attempting to piece together incoherent visions of a past long gone. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

**Multiattack**: The Vengeful Spirit makes two attacks: one with **Ghostly Touch** and one with **Terrifying Visage**.

**Ghostly Touch**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. A creature that takes necrotic damage from this attack must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have their maximum hit points reduced by the same amount. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. If a creature's maximum hit points are reduced to 0 by this effect, it dies, and the Vengeful Spirit gains temporary hit points equal to the amount reduced.

**Terrifying Visage** (Recharge 5-6): The Vengeful Spirit reveals the horrible visage of its tortured past. All creatures within 30 feet of the ghost must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Corpse-Fueled Manifestation** (Recharge 5–6): The Vengeful Spirit momentarily pulls the bodies of the dead from the city’s streets or graveyards to serve as vessels for its anger. The spirit reanimates up to 2 Medium humanoid corpses within 30 feet of it. These reanimated corpses act as allies of the Vengeful Spirit, using the **Zombie** stat block (with an initiative count of 10, losing its action on its turn unless otherwise commanded by the Vengeful Spirit). These zombies persist for 1 hour or until destroyed. The ghost may use this ability once every 1d4 rounds.

**Reactions**

**Unholy Reprisal**: When a creature within 5 feet of the Vengeful Spirit hits it with a melee attack, the spirit unleashes a burst of psychic pain. The attacker takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.

**Flavor and Setting Adjustments**

- **Appearance**: The **Vengeful Spirit of the Mourning** manifests as a spectral figure wrapped in dark, weathered clothing—an eerie, tattered suit from a forgotten time, or a flowing dress that drips with the dampness of a decaying world. Their face is distorted, worn by grief and rage, and their hollow eyes glow with an unnatural, feverish intensity. Their appearance sometimes flickers like a broken film reel, revealing glimpses of the horrific events that led to their demise: a botched investigation, a horrible accident, or a violent death at the hands of the supernatural.
- **Thematic Influence**: This ghost’s abilities reflect the lingering presence of a person who suffered a tragic fate in the early 20th century—a private investigator wronged in the line of duty, an innocent bystander to a horrific crime, or even an unfortunate soul caught up in the strange and unsettling happenings of the 1920s. Their tragic story might be tied to the haunting of the city itself or the mysterious forces controlling the domain.
- **Echoes of the Forgotten**: This ability brings to mind the sense of historical unease that permeates a 1920s city caught in a storm of social unrest, lingering trauma, and supernatural horrors. The whispering echoes that guide the victims of the spirit play into the mystery and madness of the era—victims are not just haunted by the ghost’s malice but also the grim, fractured memories of the past.
- **Corpse-Fueled Manifestation**: Drawing from the dark art of necromancy and the horrors of war or industrial accidents, the Vengeful Spirit can summon nearby bodies to do its bidding. The death tolls of industrial tragedies or wartime fatalities are invoked in this horrific ability, where the dead rise as mere tools of torment, rather than souls at rest.

**Narrative Potential**

The **Vengeful Spirit of the Mourning** could easily be tied to a tragedy in the city—a failed criminal investigation, a ghostly journalist who went missing while investigating an occult case, or a former detective who lost their life in the line of duty. As the players uncover the spectral entity's past, they might face challenges to appease the restless spirit or expose the dark secret that keeps it bound to the world of the living.
