- **Type**: Ghost (Specter)
- **Appearance**: A pale, disheveled woman in a tattered flapper dress, her face obscured by long, dark hair. When she cries, her tears are black as tar, and her mournful wails echo through the streets.
- **Background**: The spirit of a young heiress who died under mysterious circumstances, rumored to be murdered for her fortune. She roams the city in search of justice, but anyone who speaks to her or tries to help is driven to madness by the sound of her wailing voice.
- **Abilities**: She can drive NPCs insane, causing hallucinations, whispers, and uncontrollable sobbing. She is bound to a specific area (like a mansion or graveyard), and the players will need to uncover the truth behind her death to banish her spirit.
- **Twist**: Investigating her past may reveal a deeper, eldritch conspiracy involving the cults of an otherworldly being who craves human sacrifice.
