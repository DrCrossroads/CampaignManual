- **Type**: Vengeful Ghost / Echo of Violence
- **Appearance**: A faceless reflection of a murderer, locked in the moment of their crime, their hands drenched in blood. They appear in mirrors and windows and often show the victim’s last moments in full gruesome detail.
- **Background**: The vengeful spirit of a notorious murderer who was executed for their crimes, their soul condemned to repeat the crime over and over in reflections. The echoes of their violence sometimes "leak" into the real world, causing murder sprees or nightmares.
- **Abilities**: Players who encounter the reflection may find themselves trapped in a time loop of the murder, replaying it from the perspective of the victim or killer, struggling to break free. Their mental state may erode as they become unable to distinguish between the real and the reflected world.
- **Twist**: The entity can be forced into submission by uncovering the full details of its crime and understanding why it was committed.
