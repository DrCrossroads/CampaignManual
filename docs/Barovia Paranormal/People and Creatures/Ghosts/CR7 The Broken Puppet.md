**Puppeteer’s Control**: The Broken Puppet can control the movements of a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be forced to move as the Broken Puppet desires on its next turn.

**Tangled Strings**: Creatures that end their turn within 10 feet of the Broken Puppet must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become tangled in ethereal string, reducing their movement speed to 0 until they break free with a DC 15 Strength check.
