### **The Wachter Family**

- **Power Play**: The Wachter Family is ambitious and wants to replace the Vallakovichs as the dominant crime family. They may try to secretly bribe or kill Vallakovich members, or even use the party to spark a conflict that will weaken their rivals.
- **Dirty Tactics**: The Wachters have no qualms about getting their hands dirty. They may be involved in extortion, smuggling, or illegal arms deals. Their power is built on sabotage, and they might try to turn the party against other families or manipulate them for their own gain.
- **Party Interaction**: The Wachters might approach the party with a “friendship offer,” using flattery and promises of rewards to get the party to work for them. However, the party could quickly learn that working for the Wachters means playing in dangerous waters, as their unscrupulous ways could leave the party feeling like pawns.
- **Tension with Vallakovich**: If the party has already become involved with the Vallakovichs, the Wachters will be a significant enemy. They may engage in a cold war with the party, using threats, manipulation, and subterfuge to weaken their resolve or turn them into enemies of the Vallakovichs.

Their rivalry can really drive tension and give the party a powerful choice in where they want to place their allegiances. Here are a few quests and tasks that each family might offer the party to help them achieve their respective goals.

## **Wachter Family Mobsters – Cultists in Fine Clothing**

The **Wachter crime family** is unique among the Vallaki underworld. While other families focus on smuggling, extortion, and brute force, the Wachters mix **occult practices, assassinations, and political subversion** into their operations. They see themselves as **inheritors of a greater purpose**—a **gateway for the eldritch horrors lurking beneath the city.**

These mobsters are **not just criminals**; they are **zealots** devoted to **Lady Fiona Wachter** and the **Elder God she serves.** Every member of the family has **sworn themselves to a dark pact**, gaining **unnatural abilities** at the cost of their own humanity.

| **1**   | **Wachter "Friendship" Offer** – A well-dressed Wachter lieutenant approaches the party with an offer: work for them, and they’ll be well taken care of.

| **3**   | **Bribe or Threat?** – A Wachter underboss offers the party **gold (100 gp)** to plant false evidence against a Vallakovich member.

| **4**   | **Warehouse Raid** – The Wachters plan to sabotage a Vallakovich weapons shipment. The party can join in, warn the Vallakovichs, or take the goods for themselves.                                                                                                              | **Stealth (DC 15)** to avoid detection, **Thieves’ Tools (DC 14)** to break in.

| **5**   | **Strahd’s Agent** – A mysterious figure connected to Strahd appears in the streets, meeting with a Wachter family member.

If they interfere, they may earn Wachter hostility or unexpected Strahdian attention. |
| **6**   | **Spy Games** – A Wachter informant approaches the party with intelligence on a Vallakovich operation.

If false, the party is ambushed by **2d4 enforcers**.                                                                     |

| **8**   | **A Dead Vallakovich** – The party stumbles upon a Vallakovich corpse with a Wachter knife in its back.

| **10**  | **Mole in the Ranks** – A Wachter lieutenant is secretly working with the Vallakovichs.

| **11**  | **Tense Confrontation** – The party comes upon an escalating confrontation between Wachter and Vallakovich family members in a neutral space. This could result in a brutal showdown, and depending on how the party reacts, they may find themselves helping one side or both. | **Persuasion (DC 15)** to de-escalate, **Intimidation (DC 16)** to force both sides to back down, or fight breaks out (1d6+3 combatants per side).                  |
| **12**  | **The "Invitation"** – The party receives a letter inviting them to a Wachter estate gathering. It could be a setup for blackmail, recruitment, or something more sinister.                                                                                                     | Attending requires a **Charisma (DC 14) check** to navigate the social traps.                                                                                       |

## **Wachter Family (Afraid of Losing Status to the Vallakovich Family)**

The Wachter Family wants to solidify their power and remove the Vallakovichs as a threat. Here are some quests they might offer the party to gain an upper hand:

---

#### 1. **Silence a Vallakovich Ally**

**Quest Hook**: The Vallakovich Family has an ally in a neighboring district, someone with influence that could sway the balance of power. The Wachters want the party to either intimidate, bribe, or eliminate this ally before they can rally support for the Vallakovichs.

- **Objectives**:
    - Identify the Vallakovich ally and gather intel about their role in the political landscape.
    - Decide whether to use diplomacy, bribery, or intimidation to get them on the Wachter family’s side.
    - Alternatively, the party could decide to eliminate the ally entirely to prevent them from being a threat to the Wachter’s future plans.
- **Outcome**: If the party succeeds, they could win the favor of the Wachter family, and the balance of power in Barovia could tip in their favor. This may lead to rewards in the form of coin, secrets, or future backing.

---

#### 2. **Expose the Vallakovich Family’s Corruption**

**Quest Hook**: The Wachters have heard rumors about the Vallakovich family’s involvement in illegal activities or corruption within Vallaki’s law enforcement. The party is tasked with finding incriminating evidence that could expose the Vallakovich family and turn the public against them.

- **Objectives**:
    - Investigate the Vallakovich family's dealings, possibly infiltrating their inner circle.
    - Find evidence of their criminal activities, such as bribery, abuse of power, or illicit dealings with other mafia families.
    - The party could either gather physical evidence or expose the scandal to the public.
- **Outcome**: If the party can bring down the Vallakovich family’s reputation, the Wachter family will gain a significant boost in influence. The party could be handsomely rewarded or even offered a place of power in the Wachter family’s ranks.

---

#### 3. **Destroy Vallakovich’s Economic Power**

**Quest Hook**: The Vallakovich family controls much of the trade and resources in Vallaki, and the Wachter family wants to undermine their economic stronghold. They ask the party to sabotage or ruin a Vallakovich-owned business or manufacturing operation.

- **Objectives**:
    - Infiltrate one of the Vallakovich family’s businesses or factories (for example, an arms dealer or a supply chain operation they control).
    - Damage the business in a way that sends a clear message, whether through arson, theft, or other forms of sabotage.
    - Optionally, the party could blackmail the business owners into working for the Wachters instead.
- **Outcome**: Successfully weakening the Vallakovich family’s economic power would make the Wachters the dominant force in Vallaki. This would give the party a solid place in the new power structure, along with wealth or political favors.
---

### **Quest Decision Making: Choosing Between Families**

At some point in the game, the party will have to decide which family they want to side with. These quests will help them understand both families’ motivations, while also providing moral dilemmas. Do they side with the Vallakovich family for their traditional power and stability, or do they throw their support behind the Wachters, who promise more freedom and ambition?

**Hints in the Questlines**:

- The **Vallakovich family’s quests** might feel more like consolidating power and control, often with a focus on silencing or sabotaging their rivals. They may appeal to the party’s desire for order, but also offer opportunities for darker, more manipulative actions.
- The **Wachter family’s quests** may seem more chaotic and ambitious, offering the party the chance to undermine established power structures and perhaps even set things right in their own way, but their methods may be ruthless and morally ambiguous.

As the party progresses, they will also see the personal stakes behind these families. The Vallakovichs may offer stability and a familiar ruling class to cling to, while the Wachters may offer the potential for true power, but at a great cost. Which side will they choose, or will they try to play both families against each other? The decision is up to them!

### **Wachter Family (Seeking to Gain Favor with Strahd)**

The head of the Wachter Family, eager to rise in Strahd’s favor, believes that becoming the most powerful crime family will make her indispensable to Strahd. To accomplish this, she’s willing to employ the party to take down her rivals (the Vallakovichs) and ensure the Wachter Family gains dominance in Vallaki.

---

#### 1. **Undermine Vallakovich’s Influence by Exposing Their Corruption**

**Quest Hook**: The Wachter Family has uncovered a few dirty secrets about the Vallakovich family, including corruption or unsavory dealings with other factions. They ask the party to expose these secrets in a way that will tarnish the Vallakovichs' reputation and undermine their hold on power.

- **Objectives**:
    
    - Investigate the Vallakovich Family's dealings, possibly finding evidence of bribery, illegal trade, or connections with dangerous groups like the Martikovs.
    - Expose the information by leaking it to the public, framing key family members, or even organizing a scandalous public event to reveal their wrongdoings.
    - Alternatively, the party could cause a scandal involving the Vallakovich’s alliances with other, more sinister factions, using the evidence they gather to discredit the family.
- **Outcome**: If successful, the Vallakovich Family loses political and criminal support, while the Wachter Family gains power. The party earns the favor of the Wachters and may be offered significant rewards, including higher status in the family’s ranks or resources for future endeavors.

---

#### 2. **Take Down the Vallakovich Family’s Secret Allies**

**Quest Hook**: The Wachter Family has discovered that the Vallakovich Family is secretly working with a group of rival mafia families or shady business owners. The party is tasked with disrupting these alliances, possibly by turning these allies against the Vallakovichs or eliminating them altogether.

- **Objectives**:
    
    - Identify the Vallakovich Family’s allies, such as business partners, corrupt officials, or outside criminal groups.
    - Disrupt the alliance by sowing discord between them, bribing, or blackmailing key figures, or even murdering them if necessary.
    - Ensure that the alliance is publicly severed, leaving the Vallakovich Family vulnerable.
- **Outcome**: The Vallakovich Family loses their external support, and the Wachter Family consolidates power. The party would gain favor with the Wachter Family and may receive new opportunities for profitable work or political influence.

---

#### 3. **Create a Crisis Within Vallaki**

**Quest Hook**: The Wachter Family believes that in order to become the dominant power in Vallaki, they must weaken the Vallakovich Family’s control over the district. They ask the party to create a crisis, something that will destabilize the Vallakovich’s rule and turn the populace against them.

- **Objectives**:
    - Start a protest or riot among the people of Vallaki, possibly by instigating false rumors or uncovering hidden crimes committed by the Vallakovichs that will stir public outrage.
    - Orchestrate an event that causes chaos—perhaps framing the Vallakovich Family for a crime they did not commit (such as a violent attack on a prominent citizen).
    - The party could also sow division between the Vallakovich family and their own enforcers, causing internal conflict and weakening their forces.
- **Outcome**: A well-executed crisis could destabilize the Vallakovich Family’s hold on Vallaki, allowing the Wachters to step in as the city’s dominant power. The party is rewarded with influence, wealth, or connections to Strahd’s agents, further advancing the Wachter Family’s ambitions.

### **The Party’s Choice: Vallakovich vs. Wachter**

The party is faced with a difficult decision. On one side, the **Vallakovich Family** offers stability, traditional power, and possible long-term control of Vallaki. On the other hand, the **Wachter Family** offers ambition, the chance to rise through the ranks, and the promise of Strahd’s favor—potentially leading to far-reaching consequences for Barovia itself.

As the quests progress, the party will uncover more about the true stakes behind each family’s power struggle. The **Vallakovich Family** might be seen as the “establishment” that wants to maintain order but is willing to make dark deals to stay in power. The **Wachter Family**, with their ties to Strahd, represents a more unpredictable force, with the potential for both tremendous rise or terrifying ruin, depending on the party’s actions.

The quests and their consequences should lead the party into a complex web of loyalty, ambition, and betrayal, forcing them to question what they’re really fighting for and what side will truly bring Barovia closer to an uncertain future.
