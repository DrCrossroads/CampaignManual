## **Argynvost Crest** - [[Argynvost Citadel]]
### **The Silver Order**
- The Silver Order was **a militant organization of knights, investigators, and scholars** dedicated to **eradicating supernatural evils.**
- They **believed Strahd’s destruction would weaken the Elder God**, so they led **a failed crusade against him.**
- **The Order was massacred.** Their fortress was burned and left to rot, their leader slain, their relics stolen. **Strahd keeps Argynvost’s skull as a trophy.**
- The fortress has **stood abandoned for decades**, but **ghosts, lost souls, and spectral knights still linger**, trapped by their unfinished duty.

## **Structure of the Silver Order**

The Silver Order was originally a holy knightly order dedicated to the silver dragon **Argynvost**, who led them in a crusade against Strahd and the Elder God. Now, they are a fallen order of **revenants, spirits, and cursed warriors** consumed by their thirst for vengeance. The order still maintains a strict hierarchy, though its members are bound more by their **hatred for Strahd** than by discipline.

- **Grandmaster of the Silver Order** – **[[Vladimir Horngaard]]** (Revenant)
    - The former leader of the Silver Order, Vladimir is a **revenant who refuses to move on**, kept alive by his relentless hatred for Strahd.
    - He was once noble and honorable but has become **twisted by vengeance**.
    - He will not ally with anyone who seeks to **kill Strahd for reasons other than revenge.**
    - He believes that if Strahd is destroyed, **he will be damned to exist in undeath forever**, so he seeks to prolong Strahd’s suffering rather than truly destroy him.
    - His presence exerts an aura of **unholy dread**, making it hard for weaker-willed individuals to stand against him.

- **Commander of the Order** – **Sir [[Godfrey Gwilym]]** (Ghost, once Revenant)
    - Vladimir’s **former lover and second-in-command**.
    - Unlike Vladimir, Godfrey still retains **some** of his former honor and is one of the few members of the Silver Order who can be reasoned with.
    - He wishes for the Order to **find peace**, believing they have lost their way.
    - If convinced, he may attempt to **sway Vladimir** or assist the party.
    - Godfrey has begun **fading into a ghostly existence**—if not restored soon, he may be lost forever.

#### **[[CR4 Flamebearer of the Silver Order]]**
#### **[[CR5 Silent Watch of the Silver Order]]**

These **Flamebearers** and **Silent Watch** serve as powerful and tragic guardians of the **Silver Order**'s sacred grounds. Their internal conflict—striving to protect the order's legacy and hating Strahd—is a core part of their character. If the party can show reverence to their cause and restore the order’s relics, these revenants could shift from enemies to allies, providing vital aid in the fight against Strahd and the **Elder God**.

---

## **Faction Interactions**

The Silver Order interacts with other Barovian factions in different ways:

- **Zarovich Family / Strahd:**
    - The Order’s primary **sworn enemy**.
    - The revenants will attack Strahd’s agents **on sight**, often hunting them like assassins in the streets or on the roads.
    - Strahd himself largely **ignores** them, knowing they cannot truly kill him.
    - Most of Strahd’s vampire minions **fear the Order** and avoid Argynvost Crest.

- **Kolyana Family:**
    - The Kolyana Family may respect the Silver Order as **warriors against Strahd**, but they are wary of their fanaticism.
    - Some members of the Kolyana Family **seek to ally with them**, but this is difficult due to the revenants’ **uncompromising nature**.
    - If the party earns the trust of the Kolyana Family, they may gain **guidance on how to approach the Order without provoking them**.

- **The Wachter Family:**
    - The Wachters, being **Strahd loyalists**, are the **second-highest priority target** of the Silver Order.
    - Any **Wachter agents caught near Argynvost Crest** are likely to be slain or dragged off by the Order’s knights.
    - The Wachters **fear** the revenants, seeing them as an unpredictable force of destruction that cannot be reasoned with.

- **The Vallakovich Family:**
    - The Vallakovichs are **terrified** of the Silver Order but prefer to **stay out of their way**.
    - If the Vallakovichs ever gain enough power to **challenge Strahd**, they may **try to strike a deal** with the Order—but this is highly unlikely, given Vladimir’s hatred for any form of negotiation.

- **The Packhounds (Werewolves):**
    - The Silver Order **despises lycanthropes**, as werewolves were among Strahd’s **warriors** during the old war.
    - If the Silver Order encounters the **Packhounds**, they will attempt to **wipe them out** unless there is a greater threat.
    - However, werewolves are also cursed creatures, and **some revenants may pity them rather than destroy them outright**.

- **Elder God Cult in Yesterhill Point:**
    - The Order despises the **Elder God and its followers**, viewing them as a **greater evil than even Strahd.**
    - However, their hatred of Strahd **overrides their sense of duty**, and they rarely act against the cult directly.
    - If the Elder God ever **threatens to consume Barovia**, the Order **may be forced into an uneasy alliance** with other factions to stop it.

- **The Martikov Family (Wereravens):**
    - The Silver Order has no quarrel with the **wereravens**, as they are not the same as werewolves.
    - The Martikovs, however, are **terrified** of the revenants and avoid them when possible.
    - If approached correctly, the Martikovs **may provide information** on how to **safely navigate** Argynvost Crest.

## **Random Encounter Table – The Silver Order (Argynvost Crest)**

These encounters take place within **Argynvost Crest**, a ruined district between **Ravenloft and Yesterhill Point**, filled with **crumbling gothic architecture, eerie graveyards, and cold, silver flames that never die out.** The **vengeful spirits and cursed knights** of the Silver Order roam these streets, searching for Strahd’s minions—or anyone who might stand in their way.

|**d12**|**Encounter**|
|---|---|
|**1**|**Revenant Patrol** – A group of **three Revenants** (MM pg. 259) silently stalks the streets, their glowing eyes scanning for enemies. They will use **Sense Life** to detect the party within 60 feet and may mistake them for Strahd’s agents unless **a DC 16 Persuasion check** convinces them otherwise. If attacked, they fight relentlessly and pursue fleeing targets unless turned by holy magic (e.g., **Turn Undead**).|
|**2**|**Argynvost’s Ghostly Flame** – A pale **silver fire** flickers in a ruined cathedral, whispering in Draconic. Touching it grants **visions of Argynvost's final moments** (DM discretion) but also requires a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw**. On a failure, the creature suffers **one level of exhaustion** as chilling energy seeps into their bones. On a success, the creature gains **resistance to necrotic damage for 1 hour**.|
|**3**|**Silent Watcher** – A lone Revenant knight stands in the middle of the street, motionless. It does not react unless spoken to or provoked. If engaged, it cryptically warns the party **"Turn back before you are lost to the curse."** If the party attempts to attack, the revenant activates **Vow of Enmity** and fights without mercy.|
|**4**|**Restless Spirits** – The ghostly figures of **former knights and priests** walk the ruins, endlessly reenacting their past lives. If approached, they seem unaware of their deaths—until something **snaps them into awareness**, causing them to either beg for help or attack in sorrowful rage. A **DC 15 Insight check** reveals that resolving an unfinished task (e.g., restoring a lost relic) may lay them to rest. If ignored, one **Specter** (MM pg. 279) manifests per party member.|
|**5**|**Duels of the Damned** – Two Revenants are locked in an **eternal duel** over a perceived betrayal. Their weapons strike but deal **no damage**, their battle a cursed cycle. If the party **interrupts or attempts to mediate**, they must make a **DC 16 Persuasion check** to free the spirits. On a failure, both Revenants turn their aggression toward the party, attacking immediately.|
|**6**|**Cursed Cemetery** – The party stumbles upon **a massive graveyard**, its tombstones glowing with silver runes. Investigating the area requires a **DC 15 Arcana or Religion check** to determine that disturbing the graves may **awaken a vengeful spirit**. If the party ignores this warning and disturbs the ground, a **Wraith** (MM pg. 302) rises, summoning **1d4 Specters**. Proper burial rites or a **DC 14 Religion check** may put the spirits to rest.|
|**7**|**Sir Godfrey’s Lament** – The ghost of **Sir Godfrey Gwilym** (modified Revenant) watches the ruins from a balcony. He may be convinced to speak with the party with a **DC 17 Persuasion check**, offering cryptic warnings about Vladimir's wrath and the Order’s **true fate.** If the party earns his trust, he provides **advantage on Insight checks** against Revenants in Argynvost Crest and reveals **Vladimir’s hidden weakness** (DM discretion).|
|**8**|**Revenant Hunters** – A group of **1d4 Revenants** is actively hunting down **a vampire spawn** loyal to Strahd. The Revenants will stop at nothing to execute the target, even if it means collateral damage. The party must choose to **aid the revenants (fighting the spawn)** or **protect the spawn (fighting the revenants)**. A **DC 16 Persuasion check** may cause the revenants to delay their pursuit if the party offers a better strategy.|
|**9**|**Fallen Flamebearer** – A **Skeletal Priest** (use **Wight** stats, MM pg. 300, but replace Longsword with Radiant Flame attacks) prays at a ruined altar, attempting to rekindle the holy silver fire. If aided with a **DC 14 Religion check**, he grants the party a **Lesser Blessing of Argynvost (advantage on saving throws vs. undead for 24 hours).** If disturbed or attacked, he casts **Inflict Wounds (4th level, 6d10 necrotic damage)** and fights until destroyed.|
|**10**|**The Voice of Argynvost** – A spectral vision of **Argynvost’s spirit** manifests before the party, speaking in riddles and warning of **a greater darkness beneath Barovia.** If the party listens, they receive a clue about the **Elder God’s presence** (DM discretion). If they show hostility, Argynvost’s vision **disappears in sorrow**, and all Revenants in the district gain **advantage on attack rolls against the party for 24 hours.**|
|**11**|**Trapped in a Nightmare** – The party suddenly finds themselves in a **vision of the past**, reliving the Order’s last battle against Strahd. Each party member must succeed on a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or become **paralyzed** for 1 minute as they mentally relive their own deaths in the vision. The illusion can be broken by **casting Dispel Magic or Protection from Evil and Good**, or by succeeding on **another DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** at the end of their turn.|
|**12**|**Vladimir’s Warning** – Grandmaster **Vladimir Horngaard** (MM pg. 259) himself appears, either by his own will or because the party **has drawn too much attention.** He will test their resolve, questioning their purpose in Barovia. If he deems them unworthy, he casts **Hunter’s Mark** and commands **1d4 Revenants** to eliminate them. If the party convinces him of their sincerity (**DC 18 Persuasion or Intimidation check**), he allows them to leave but warns that he will **never aid them in their cause.**|
### **Optional Modifiers**

- **During the Witching Hour (Midnight - 3 AM):** Encounters with spirits become more frequent, and the revenants become more **hostile and irrational**.
- **During a Storm:** The voices of the dead **scream in the wind**, and silver flames burn erratically. Any encounter involving spirits is more **powerful**.
- **If the Party Carries a Holy Relic:** Revenants may hesitate to attack or even **offer guidance**, but only if the relic is linked to **Argynvost** or the Order.
