## **Yesterhill Point**
### **Evil Druids - The Drowned Circle**
Their reverence for the **Elder God beneath the sea** has warped them, body and mind. They see themselves as **prophets of the deep**, spreading its influence through twisted nature magic, blood rituals, and sinister prophecy.

- **Territory:** Yesterhill Point – A **fog-drenched park, ancient trees twisted by unnatural growth**, and a towering **lighthouse**, its beam flickering with eerie, color-shifting light.
- **Operations:** **Spreading the will of the Elder God**. They **sacrifice outsiders**, **summon aberrations**, and **manipulate nature itself** to reshape Barovia in the image of the deep.
- **Enemies:** The **Martikovs** (who view them as a corruption of nature), the **Packhounds** (who tread too close to their sacred waters), and **anyone who disrupts their rituals**.
- **Tactics:** They use **sabotage, curses, and mind-warping magic**, rather than direct confrontations.

### **How They Fit into the World**

- The **Martikovs** despise them, as their **corrupted nature magic** is an insult to true druidic traditions.
- The **Packhounds** have **tense relations** with them—**werewolves that wander too close to Yesterhill Point have begun "changing" in ways they cannot explain.**
- The **Vallakovich and Wachter families** largely **ignore them**, considering them lunatics… but they may **pay for their services** if they can use their magic for assassination or sabotage.
- Strahd is **aware of them** but does **not trust them**—he sees them as **pawns of a greater power**, and he will **not allow another god to rule Barovia**.

| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | **Whispers on the Tide** – The wind carries an unsettling **whispered chant**, promising the listener **power and secrets** if they come closer to the sea. The words _shouldn’t_ be understandable, yet they are.                                                               | PCs must make a **DC 15 Wisdom Save** or suffer **visions of the deep** (one level of exhaustion, disadvantage on Perception for an hour).      |
| **2**   | **Blood in the Water** – A group of druids stands at the cliffs near the lighthouse, **casting bodies into the sea**. The bodies thrash, then still, as unnatural **tentacles** rise to claim them.                                                                              | Interfering triggers a battle against **2d4 Drowned Acolytes (CR 2 each).**                                                                     |
| **3**   | **The Lighthouse’s Beacon** – The lighthouse's beam shifts to an **unnatural color**, bathing the district in an **unearthly glow**. Anyone caught in it **hears whispers, sees flickering figures in the mist, and feels a pull toward the ocean**.                             | PCs must make a **DC 14 Charisma Save** or become **compelled to walk toward the sea** for 1 minute.                                            |
| **4**   | **Twisted Flora** – The plants in the park are **wrong**—trees **ooze black ichor**, flowers open to reveal **unblinking eyes**, and **a great, pulsing root mass** spreads beneath the earth. A druid approaches, smiling, asking if the party would like to _"feed the root."_ | Digging into the mass awakens **1d4 Rootspawn Horrors (CR 3 each).**                                                                            |
| **5**   | **A Druid’s Warning** – A lone druid, ragged and desperate, stumbles into the party’s path. "I have seen the deep. We were wrong. It comes." Before he can say more, his **body twists and snaps**, and he collapses into an **oozing, inhuman husk**.                           | **Arcana or Religion (DC 16)** reveals he was undergoing **forced transformation**. If looted, his body contains **an inky, pulsing stone**.    |
| **6**   | **The Ritual Begins** – A **group of cultists** surrounds a standing stone, their bodies writhing as they chant. A **hole in reality itself** yawns open, and something _is coming through_.                                                                                     | Stopping them in **3 rounds** prevents the **summoning of a Deep Maw (CR 6)**.                                                                  |
| **7**   | **Marked by the Abyss** – A deep, crushing **sense of being watched** falls over the party. One PC finds **strange symbols** carved into their skin—**they weren’t there before.**                                                                                               | The marked PC must make **a DC 15 Wisdom Save each night**, or suffer **nightmares of drowning**, waking with **1 level of exhaustion**.        |
| **8**   | **Feral Converts** – A **Packhound werewolf** stumbles into the party’s path, foaming at the mouth, **half-transformed** into something _wrong._ His body is **slick with seawater,** and his **eyes are pure black**.                                                           | The werewolf **mutters in Deep Speech** and then **attacks wildly**. If captured, he knows of a **forbidden ritual the druids are performing.** |
| **9**   | **Drowned Spirits** – **Translucent figures** float just above the ground, **muttering prayers** to something beneath the waves. If spoken to, they warn the party **not to go near the lighthouse at low tide.**                                                                | PCs who heed their warning **gain advantage on Perception checks** near the lighthouse later.                                                   |
| **10**  | **The High Druid’s Command** – The leader of the druids, a terrifying figure wreathed in **kelp and seafoam**, addresses a **gathering of followers**. "The tides shall rise, and Barovia will drown."

| **11**  | **The Eyes Below** – The party sees **dozens of glowing eyes beneath the surface of the water**, watching. The longer they stare, the more they feel their **own reflection begin to move independently.**                                                                       | PCs who fail a **DC 14 Sanity Save** (or Intelligence) will **see their reflections whisper secrets about them that no one should know.**       |
| **12**  | **The Lighthouse Doors Open** – The lighthouse, always **locked and abandoned**, **opens on its own.** The inside is **impossibly vast**, filled with **spiraling barnacle-covered stairs** leading down into utter blackness. Something **waits at the bottom**.                | **Entering begins a mini-dungeon**, where reality itself is **warped by the Elder God’s presence.**                                             |
