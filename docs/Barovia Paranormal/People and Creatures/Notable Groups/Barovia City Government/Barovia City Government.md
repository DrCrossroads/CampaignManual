Barovia City is technically a "free city" under the iron shadow of the Church and the silent consent of Count Strahd von Zarovich. It maintains a **facade of self-governance**, but in reality, it's a seething stew of bribery, blackmail, and backdoor deals.

### The Mayor (Puppet-In-Chief)

**Name**: [[Mayor Godfrey Wren]]

### City Government Bodies

- **The Council of Shadows**: Supposedly dissolved decades ago, but whispered to still exist — made of representatives from different guilds and factions who manipulate the city behind closed doors.
- **Public Services Committee**: Handles “infrastructure” but mainly exists to launder money through public works.

## QUEST HOOKS INVOLVING THE MAYOR

### **“An Invitation to Dinner”**

The mayor invites the players to a fancy dinner at his manor to “recognize their civic efforts.” In truth, he’s terrified they’re getting too powerful and wants to size them up. The dinner includes:

- An attempted poisoning.
- Nobles asking odd questions (“Do you believe in public executions?”).
- A servant slipping them a note: _“The mayor is lying. He works for HIM.”_

**Outcomes**:
- Discovering evidence of his pact with Strahd.
- Being asked to do a "favor" for him to avoid scandal.
- Gaining blackmail leverage over the mayor.

### **“Burn the Witch—Quietly”**

The Church pressures the mayor to arrest a known heretic (secretly a healer helping the poor). He complies, but the case is shaky. A civil trial looms — public unrest is building.

**The players can**:
- Defend the accused in a courtroom drama.
- Investigate the mayor’s handling of the arrest and uncover doctored records.
- Be offered a bribe to _make the problem go away_.

### **“Unfit for Office”**

One of the gangs (or a revolutionary faction) wants to oust the mayor. They approach the party with a bold plan: help rig the next city election or plant evidence to remove him via scandal.

**Potential Complications**:
- The replacement candidate may be worse.
- Strahd might intervene if the mayor is threatened.
- A mysterious benefactor offers a counter-deal: _keep the mayor alive — for a price._

### **“The Ghost in the Records”**

City archives are mysteriously closed. Rumors say old records show how the mayor _stole the office_, maybe through blood pacts or shadow deals. A journalist asks the players to break in.

**Inside they find**:
- Contracts signed in blood.
- A ledger showing monthly "donations" from crime lords.
- Sigils in ancient ink hinting at dark magic buried beneath City Hall.

### **“Mayoral Decree #117”**

The mayor suddenly bans all arcane magic within city limits. Anyone caught casting is arrested. This is done under Church pressure — but the timing is _odd_. Something's coming.

**Leads the players to**:
- Investigate the timing: is the mayor afraid of something?
- Track down a secret magical riot squad being funded by City Hall.
- Defy the ban and rally mages to resist.


## Optional Twist Ideas

- **The mayor is undead**: He doesn’t know it. He was brought back as a revenant-puppet by Strahd after being assassinated years ago. He sometimes "blacks out" during decisions.
- **Double Agent**: He’s secretly trying to pit the crime families against one another and wants the party to unknowingly help destabilize the system so he can grab more power.
