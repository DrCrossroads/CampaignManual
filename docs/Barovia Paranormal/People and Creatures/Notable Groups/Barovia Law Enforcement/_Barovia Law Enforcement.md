[[Prohibition, the Police, and The Church of the Eternal Light]]

## Police Officers
#### **[[CR1 Barovian Constable]]**
#### **[[CR2 Barovian Sergeant]]**
#### **[[CR3 Barovian Captain]]**

---

These **Barovian Police Officers** are a mix of city enforcers, each with increasing levels of authority and tactics. As the officers rise in rank, they gain access to more commanding and tactical abilities, able to coordinate with others and instill fear to maintain control. They are loyal to Strahd’s rule, but their methods vary depending on rank and temperament. These officers may be encountered in random patrols, public punishments, or guarding important locations in Barovia.

## **Random Encounter Table: Law Enforcement in Barovia**
_These encounters reflect the complicated relationship between the police, the Church of the Eternal Light, and the criminal underworld. Some officers enforce the law, some resist the Church, and others are corrupt or opportunistic._

| **D12** | **Encounter**                               | **Description & Mechanics**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **1**   | **Zealous Purifier Crackdown**              | A squad of **Purifiers** is harassing a group of suspected bootleggers, preparing to burn their contraband in the street. If the party intervenes, the Purifiers turn their ire on them. (DC 15 Persuasion to defuse; otherwise, combat may ensue.) |
| **2**   | **Church-Friendly Officers on Patrol**      | A group of city guards, loyal to the Church, stop the party for questioning. They demand proof of righteousness—no alcohol, no known criminal ties. (If the party is suspicious, they may be detained or forced to bribe their way out.)            |
| **3**   | **Undercover Mafia Ally**                   | A plainclothes officer subtly signals the party to meet him in an alley. He’s on the Mafia’s payroll and offers information about an upcoming Church raid. (If the party accepts, they gain advance warning of a future conflict.)                  |
| **4**   | **Desperate Informant**                     | A jittery young officer pulls the party aside. He knows too much about the Church’s dark dealings and is looking for protection. He begs the party to help him flee the city before he's "purified."                                                |
| **5**   | **Corrupt Officers Shaking Down a Citizen** | Two officers, clearly on the take, are extorting a desperate merchant for "sin taxes." If the party steps in, they can either bribe them off (50gp) or fight. If they leave, the merchant later vanishes.                                           |
| **6**   | **Righteous Officer Needs Help**            | A lone officer with a grudge against the Church is looking for allies. He asks the party to help expose a **Purifier death squad** operating in the city. (If they accept, they get a lead on a secret Church safe house.)                          |
| **7**   | **Raid on a Speakeasy**                     | The police storm a secret bar, arresting patrons. The party can either blend in and avoid detection (DC 16 Stealth) or help someone escape, earning a favor from the criminal underworld.                                                           |
| **8**   | **Church & Police Power Struggle**          | A loud argument is unfolding between a police captain and a high-ranking cleric. Tensions are high, and the party can tip the scales by siding with one faction. (Gaining favor with one may make an enemy of the other.)                           |
| **9**   | **A Body in the Gutter**                    | The party stumbles across a dead officer in an alley. Investigation reveals he was killed for knowing too much about the Church’s operations. (Following the clues leads to a deeper conspiracy.)                                                   |
| **10**  | **Rogue Detective’s Warning**               | A grizzled detective warns the party: "You're making enemies. The Church doesn’t like loose ends." He offers a cryptic lead—"Look for the ones who don’t drink"—before vanishing.                                                                   |
| **11**  | **Drunk and Disorderly Officer**            | A heavily intoxicated officer, sick of the Church’s control, drunkenly rants in public. He’s got information but is too incoherent to be useful unless sobered up (DC 14 Persuasion or **Lesser Restoration**).                                     |
| **12**  | **Framed for a Crime**                      | Someone planted contraband on the party! Officers stop them for a "random search" and immediately "find" illegal goods. The party must talk their way out (DC 18 Deception/Persuasion), fight, or escape.                                           |
