### **The Vallakovich Family**

- **Fear of Losing Power**: The Vallakovich Family, long in control of one of the most important districts in Barovia, is terrified of losing their influence to the Wachter Family. They may try to manipulate the party into attacking or undermining the Wachters.
- **Corruption**: The Vallakovichs are well-connected with law enforcement, as they have a corrupt cop on the payroll. This officer could provide a way for the party to gather information or cause trouble, but there’s always a sense of danger when dealing with the Vallakovichs. The corrupt cop could be a spy or mole for a rival family, depending on what the party uncovers.
- **Party Interaction**: The party could be used as a pawn by the Vallakovichs to deal with their enemies, or they could be blackmailed into working for them if they know something compromising. They may offer the party protection or valuable resources if they help them against the Wachters.
- **Wachters' Rivalry**: The Vallakovichs' rivalry with the Wachters could create moments of tension, especially if the party is caught in the crossfire. The Vallakovichs are willing to do anything to maintain their hold on power, so they'll play dirty when necessary.

Vargas Vallakovich does not **personally enforce his will**—instead, he has a **network of enforcers, assassins, and spies** to keep his iron grip on the city.

## **Vallakovich Enforcers – The Hidden Fangs of the Family**

The Vallakovich enforcers are **elite killers, spies, and thugs**, personally vetted by Vargas himself. They are separated into **three tiers**, each specializing in **different forms of combat and subterfuge.**

## **Vallakovich Family (Afraid of Losing Status to the Wachter Family)**

The Vallakovich Family, fearing the Wachter Family's increasing influence and ties to Strahd, wants to maintain their position of power in Vallaki. They will offer the party tasks that involve disrupting or undermining the Wachters’ rise while reinforcing their own dominance in the city.

The Vallakovich Family is nervous about the Wachter Family's growing influence and their control over the law enforcement in Barovia, so they may want to discredit or undermine them. Here are some potential quests:

---

#### 1. **Disrupt the Wachter Family’s Influence Over the Law**

**Quest Hook**: The Vallakovich family has learned that the Wachter family has a corrupt cop on their payroll, one who is slowly building more power over the city’s law enforcement. They ask the party to gather evidence of the cop's corruption or eliminate him before he gains more influence.

- **Objectives**:
    - Investigate the cop’s dealings and find evidence of his illegal activities.
    - If the party is feeling less subtle, they could kill or frame the cop for something heinous.
    - If the party leans toward a more diplomatic or clever route, they could expose the cop’s corruption publicly to strip the Wachters of their leverage.
- **Outcome**: If successful, the Vallakovich family gains leverage and removes a threat to their influence. This would earn the party favor with them, possibly even financial rewards, as well as political support within Vallaki.

---

#### 2. **Sabotage the Wachter Family’s Growing Network**

**Quest Hook**: The Vallakovich family is aware that the Wachters have been expanding their influence among the city’s criminal and political circles. The party is hired to sabotage one of their business deals, perhaps a secret alliance with a dangerous group like the Martikovs or a rival mafia.

- **Objectives**:
    - Infiltrate a high-stakes meeting or business deal between the Wachters and another faction (e.g., the Martikov Family or a group of shady businessmen).
    - Disrupt the deal or steal crucial information that would make the deal fall apart.
    - Alternatively, the party could plant evidence of betrayal or foul play within the Wachter faction, making their allies turn on them.
- **Outcome**: Successfully sabotaging the Wachter’s deals would weaken their standing in Barovia and solidify Vallakovich’s control. The party would gain powerful allies in Vallaki and perhaps even a stake in future business dealings within the city.

---

#### 3. **Deal with a Rebel Leader in Vallaki**

**Quest Hook**: There are murmurs of dissent in Vallaki as some citizens are quietly pushing back against the Vallakovich family’s heavy-handed rule. The party is asked to track down and eliminate or discredit a charismatic rebel leader who has been rallying the townsfolk to their cause.

- **Objectives**:
    - Find the rebel leader, possibly hiding in an underground movement, and gather intelligence about their plans.
    - Decide whether to eliminate the leader through force or sabotage their influence.
    - If the party prefers a non-violent approach, they could try to turn the leader’s followers against them, or frame the leader for something that will turn the people of Vallaki against them.
- **Outcome**: By eliminating or neutralizing the rebel leader, the party strengthens the Vallakovich family’s grip on Vallaki. The family might reward the party with access to higher society, wealth, or future influence.

### **Quest Decision Making: Choosing Between Families**

At some point in the game, the party will have to decide which family they want to side with. These quests will help them understand both families’ motivations, while also providing moral dilemmas. Do they side with the Vallakovich family for their traditional power and stability, or do they throw their support behind the Wachters, who promise more freedom and ambition?

**Hints in the Questlines**:

- The **Vallakovich family’s quests** might feel more like consolidating power and control, often with a focus on silencing or sabotaging their rivals. They may appeal to the party’s desire for order, but also offer opportunities for darker, more manipulative actions.
- The **Wachter family’s quests** may seem more chaotic and ambitious, offering the party the chance to undermine established power structures and perhaps even set things right in their own way, but their methods may be ruthless and morally ambiguous.

As the party progresses, they will also see the personal stakes behind these families. The Vallakovichs may offer stability and a familiar ruling class to cling to, while the Wachters may offer the potential for true power, but at a great cost. Which side will they choose, or will they try to play both families against each other? The decision is up to them!

### **Quests for Vallakovich Family v Wachter**
#### 1. **Expose the Wachter Family’s Allegiance with Strahd**

**Quest Hook**: The Vallakovich family has long suspected the Wachter Family’s ambitions to ally with Strahd, and they want to prevent this from happening. They ask the party to gather proof of the Wachter Family's secret dealings with the Zarovich family.

- **Objectives**:
    - Investigate the Wachter Family’s private dealings, such as intercepted letters, secret meetings, or eyewitnesses.
    - Uncover evidence of their attempts to gain favor with Strahd—perhaps secret meetings with Strahd’s agents or a plan to offer something valuable in exchange for power.
    - Expose the evidence to the people of Vallaki, potentially causing a public scandal or turning key allies against the Wachter family.
- **Outcome**: If successful, the Vallakovich Family's standing is solidified, and the party would gain favor with them. They might reward the party with political connections, wealth, or increased influence within Vallaki. The public shaming of the Wachter Family could also weaken their hold on the district.

---

#### 2. **Sabotage a Wachter Family Business Deal**

**Quest Hook**: The Wachter Family is making strides in gaining control over a profitable business—perhaps a lucrative supply chain involving imported goods, or an illegal trade of rare items. The Vallakovich Family sees this as a threat and asks the party to sabotage the deal before it goes through.

- **Objectives**:
    - Infiltrate a business meeting between the Wachters and their potential allies (perhaps a rival mafia or the Martikovs).
    - Disrupt the deal by planting false information, stealing valuable documents, or causing chaos at the meeting.
    - Optionally, the party could frame one of the Wachter Family members for a crime, discrediting their negotiation efforts.
- **Outcome**: Successfully sabotaging the deal weakens the Wachters’ business and solidifies the Vallakovich Family’s power. The Vallakovichs would be grateful, providing the party with rewards or protection from their enemies in Vallaki.

---

#### 3. **Defeat a Wachter Family Enforcer**

**Quest Hook**: The Vallakovich Family has learned that one of the Wachter Family’s enforcers has been making moves to intimidate the Vallakovich’s supporters and strengthen their grip on Vallaki. The party is tasked with eliminating or capturing this enforcer, either to send a message or to gain leverage over the Wachter Family.

- **Objectives**:
    - Track down the Wachter enforcer (likely a tough, dangerous figure or even a vampire thrall), who is terrorizing Vallaki’s population.
    - Defeat or capture the enforcer and return them to the Vallakovich Family.
    - Alternatively, the party could take the enforcer’s place and create confusion within the Wachter Family’s operations by impersonating them.
- **Outcome**: Successfully neutralizing the enforcer not only weakens the Wachters but also sends a clear message of defiance to their rise in Vallaki. The Vallakovich Family rewards the party with riches, connections, or other forms of power.

### **The Party’s Choice: Vallakovich vs. Wachter**

The party is faced with a difficult decision. On one side, the **Vallakovich Family** offers stability, traditional power, and possible long-term control of Vallaki. On the other hand, the **Wachter Family** offers ambition, the chance to rise through the ranks, and the promise of Strahd’s favor—potentially leading to far-reaching consequences for Barovia itself.

As the quests progress, the party will uncover more about the true stakes behind each family’s power struggle. The **Vallakovich Family** might be seen as the “establishment” that wants to maintain order but is willing to make dark deals to stay in power. The **Wachter Family**, with their ties to Strahd, represents a more unpredictable force, with the potential for both tremendous rise or terrifying ruin, depending on the party’s actions.

The quests and their consequences should lead the party into a complex web of loyalty, ambition, and betrayal, forcing them to question what they’re really fighting for and what side will truly bring Barovia closer to an uncertain future.
