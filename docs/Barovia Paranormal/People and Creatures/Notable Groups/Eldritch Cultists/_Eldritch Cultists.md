## **Random Encounter Table – Eldritch Cultists (Citywide Encounters)**
The eldritch cultists devoted to the **Elder God beneath the sea** operate in secrecy, blending into society or lurking in the shadows. Their influence spreads across the city, from the docks to the high-rises, their whispers carried by the wind. These encounters represent the party’s growing entanglement with their machinations.

|d12|Encounter|Description|Mechanics|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|**The Starving Preacher**|A ragged man rants about “the coming tide” and “the end of all things.” His eyes are completely black.|If approached, he tries to grasp a party member and whisper **forbidden knowledge**. The target must make a **DC 13 Wisdom save** or suffer **1 level of exhaustion** due to an onslaught of maddening visions.|
|2|**Unholy Mark**|A strange **sigil** appears on a wall near the party. It shifts unnaturally when looked at.|Observing it for too long requires a **DC 14 Intelligence save** or suffer **disadvantage on Insight checks** for 1 hour due to lingering confusion.|
|3|**Silent Procession**|A group of **robed figures** walks the streets in eerie silence, carrying unlit lanterns. They stop to stare at the party.|If followed, they lead to an abandoned building where they perform **a dark ritual**. Interrupting it triggers combat with **1d6 Cultists (MM) and a Cult Fanatic (MM)**.|
|4|**An Impossible Whisper**|The party hears a voice calling their name, but no one is around.|A **DC 15 Perception check** reveals a figure in the shadows that disappears when approached. Failing a **DC 14 Wisdom save** causes unsettling paranoia, giving **disadvantage on the next Wisdom check**.|
|5|**Lurking Worshippers**|A group of cultists gathers at a street corner, hands trembling as they murmur in unison.|If confronted, they disperse, but one leaves behind a scrap of parchment detailing **an upcoming ritual**.|
|6|**The Drowned Man**|A bloated, waterlogged corpse is found in an alleyway, its skin covered in **barnacle-like growths**.|A **DC 14 Investigation or Medicine check** reveals that the body was not drowned in normal water but something **unnatural**.|
|7|**The Candlelit Door**|A single doorway, lined with **dozens of candles**, flickers in an alley. Inside, a ritual is underway.|Entering interrupts **a summoning**, forcing the cult leader to call forth **a minor aberration** (DM’s choice).|
|8|**The Fish-Eyed Beggar**|A beggar with grotesquely **bulging eyes** asks the party for coin. If given, he whispers, “The Deep One watches you now.”|If ignored, he follows the party for several blocks, muttering in an **unknown language** before vanishing.|
|9|**The Sky Bleeds**|For a brief moment, the sky above the city **turns dark and ripples**, as if submerged in water.|Anyone looking up must succeed a **DC 13 Intelligence save** or experience **a brief flash of another world**, leaving them shaken.|
|10|**A Familiar Face**|A trusted NPC has been **compromised**. Their pupils are dilated, their words rehearsed, and they try to lure the party into a trap.|If pressed, they attempt to **activate an eldritch glyph**, requiring a **DC 15 Dexterity save** to avoid psychic damage (4d6).|
|11|**The Street Sacrifice**|The party stumbles upon a **freshly slain body**, its wounds forming a spiral pattern. The blood flows **against gravity** toward a nearby sewer drain.|A **DC 16 Arcana or Religion check** reveals this as part of a **larger ritual**—one the party might be able to disrupt.|

#### **Cult Leaders & Eldritch Figures**

1. **Madam Eva (Prophet of the Elder God)** – A **mysterious seer** who guides the party with **half-truths** while secretly orchestrating the Grand Ritual.
    - **Public Image:** Respected **fortune teller and dreamwalker**.
    - **Secret Role:** Prophet of the Elder God, manipulating events behind the scenes.
    - **Personality:** **Calm, wise, and eerily kind**, but her words twist fate itself.

2. **Baba Lysaga (High Priestess of the Mist)** – A **fanatical cult leader** seeking to **usurp Strahd’s control** and bring the Mist’s power to its full potential.
    - **Public Image:** **Feared urban legend**, rumored to live in the deepest fog-choked slums.
    - **Secret Role:** The **true master of the Mist**, able to bend it to her will.
    - **Personality:** **Ruthless and erratic**, wielding both occult power and criminal influence.

3. **Father Alaric Durnst (Preacher of the Apocalypse)** – A **deranged street preacher** who warns of the Elder God’s coming, claiming he will **ascend with it**.
    - **Public Image:** **Lunatic preacher** shouting doomsday prophecies on street corners.
    - **Secret Role:** **An unstable, but insightful**, servant of the Dream Walkers.
    - **Personality:** **Paranoid, trembling, but strangely accurate** in his visions.

4. **Father Dorian Graves – The Shepherd of the Veil**
- **Cult:** _The Veilkeepers_ – A doomsday cult that believes the Elder God is already seeping through the cracks in reality, and their job is to help the world _transition_ into its new form.
- **Persona:** A once-respected preacher who lost his faith in the Church of the Eternal Light after witnessing an eldritch vision. Now, he wears the robes of a prophet and preaches that the world is already damned—those who embrace the change will be _exalted_ in the new order.
- **Appearance:** Gaunt, hollow-cheeked, and dressed in tattered black robes that were once a priest’s vestments. His eyes are permanently bloodshot, and his hands are always trembling, as though he's caught between two realities.
- **Methods:**
    - Disguises his cult as a small, underground congregation, drawing in lost souls and religious outcasts.
    - Speaks in cryptic, poetic phrases that seem nonsensical—until the meaning becomes terrifyingly clear.
    - Believes that reality itself is thinning, and he orchestrates rituals that cause localized distortions, where time loops, objects flicker in and out of existence, and whispers leak through the walls.
- **Secret Weakness:** He’s terrified of what will happen when the final “veil” is lifted—but he’s already too far gone to stop himself.

5. **Madame Sybil Raines – The Oracle of the Crimson Eye**
- **Cult:** _The Crimson Eye_ – A clandestine cabal of scholars, occultists, and wealthy socialites who seek knowledge hidden in the fabric of the cosmos. They do not worship the Elder God directly but seek to _understand_ it, no matter the cost.
- **Persona:** A refined, calculating woman who speaks with absolute certainty, as though she has already seen every possible future. She runs exclusive gatherings for Barovia City’s elite, where strange whispers fill the air and secrets are exchanged like currency.
- **Appearance:** Elegant and composed, always clad in deep red silk and wearing a veil that covers her left eye. Beneath it is a _glowing_ crimson iris, a mark of her unnatural knowledge.
- **Methods:**
    - Uses her influence to attract wealthy patrons, politicians, and intellectuals into her orbit.
    - Conducts séances, dreamwalks, and other rituals to extract secrets from beyond.
    - Has agents embedded in the city’s newspapers, universities, and libraries, ensuring that dangerous knowledge is hidden—or manipulated.
- **Secret Weakness:** Her visions are not as controlled as she claims. The Crimson Eye whispers _too many_ futures, and she’s beginning to lose track of which reality is real.

6. **"Doctor" Felix Mercer – The Surgeon of the Flesh Choir**
- **Cult:** _The Flesh Choir_ – A grotesque sect that believes the Elder God’s influence manifests in physical transformation. They _embrace_ mutation, altering their bodies in unnatural ways to better serve “the Voice Beyond.”
- **Persona:** A former surgeon who lost his medical license after a series of _experimental_ procedures. Felix Mercer now runs a hidden laboratory where he performs rituals and surgeries that merge the arcane with the anatomical. He believes that flesh is _fluid_, and that reshaping the human form is the first step toward _true enlightenment_.
- **Appearance:** An unnervingly clean-shaven man in bloodstained surgical attire, wearing round spectacles with cracked lenses. His fingers are too long—stretched and augmented by his own work. He never blinks.
- **Methods:**
    - Kidnaps vagrants, criminals, and the desperate to use as _subjects_ in his experiments.
    - Operates out of an abandoned hospital, where the halls echo with unnatural voices.
    - Has created a small group of _"Ascended"_—horribly altered cultists whose bodies twist and shift with the unnatural energy within them.
- **Secret Weakness:** His own body is beginning to break down from the unnatural changes, but he refuses to stop his _work_.
