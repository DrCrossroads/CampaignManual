## **The Martikov Family**

- **Bootlegging and Moonshine**: The Martikovs are primarily focused on bootlegging, particularly the trade of a magical liquor that is said to have properties that can either heal or curse. They could be an important source of information or resources for the party, especially if they are searching for items to fight the supernatural forces.
- **Hidden Loyalties**: Though they appear friendly to the party, the Martikovs are not above using the party for their own gain. If the family is involved in anything dark or supernatural (such as connections to lycanthropes or witches), they may later ask the party to help them with an unsavory task.
- **Party Interaction**: Since they start friendly, they can offer aid, be a safe haven for the party, or provide information about Barovia’s dark secrets. However, the family might have their own hidden agendas that could complicate things later on, especially if they need the party to handle delicate matters, such as eliminating competition or solving a family mystery.


### **Martikov Family Overview:**

The Martikovs are a family of [[CR3 Wereraven]] who own a successful bootlegging operation. Their winery provides a rare, high-quality alcohol (perhaps something like a moonshine, or a type of vintage that becomes a symbol of power and prestige in Barovia), but they’ve run into significant trouble. The patriarch of the family is a staunch, cold figure who is deeply focused on his business, and initially, he won’t be trusting of the party. However, his eldest son is much more approachable and sees the potential for the party to help them, forging a potential alliance over time.

Once the party helps with the **bootlegging business**, the Martikovs will become much more welcoming and may even offer their protection and assistance when needed.

## **The Keepers of the Feather – The Martikov Family's Shadow**

_"Blood and ink stain the ledger, but only the Keepers know which marks must be erased."_

### **What They Are:**

The Keepers of the Feather are an **elite, secretive sect** within the Martikov family, **trusted with the family’s deepest secrets, most delicate jobs, and deadliest missions.** While the larger Martikov operation focuses on **bootlegging, smuggling, and fencing stolen goods**, the **Keepers handle espionage, blackmail, assassinations, and counter-intelligence** against the other crime families.

Unlike other Martikov smugglers, Keepers are not just **wereravens**—they are **the most skilled, disciplined, and cunning members of the family**. Some believe the Keepers possess **occult knowledge** or **rituals that grant them an even deeper connection to the darkness of the city.**

---

### **Roles & Responsibilities**

- **Intelligence Gathering:** Keepers use their **raven forms** to **spy on rival crime families, corrupt politicians, and even supernatural entities**.
- **Assassination & "Disappearances":** When the Martikovs need **someone erased quietly**, a Keeper will **ensure the body is never found.**
- **Whisper Brokers:** They trade in **secrets**, dealing with **coded messages, blackmail material, and forbidden knowledge.**
- **The Family’s Last Resort:** If a **Martikov turns traitor**, it is the **Keepers** who deal with them. No one betrays the family and lives.

---

### **Initiation & Symbolism**

- To join the Keepers, a candidate must **prove absolute loyalty** and **pass the Flight of Shadows**, a **test of wit, stealth, and ruthlessness.**
- Once accepted, members are given a **black feather insignia**—a **silver pin, tattoo, or ring** marking them as part of the inner circle.
- Keepers **never use their real names** within the organization. They are referred to by **code names** like _Blackwing, Hollow Beak, The Mourning Dove, or The Last Feather._

---

### **Structure & Notable Members**

#### **The Flockmaster (Leader of the Keepers)**

- The **most feared and respected member** of the Martikovs, their true identity is **a mystery** to all but a few.
- They **wear a mask** during meetings and are said to have **a supernatural ability to see through all lies.**

#### **Harbingers (High-Ranking Keepers, CR 7-8 Operatives)**

- The **right hand of the Flockmaster**—a mix of **strategists, assassins, and spies.**
- Each Harbinger controls a **specific part of the city** or a **key operation** (e.g., _The Docks, The Black Market, The Smuggler’s Guild_).
- Harbingers often use **coded letters and secret dead drops** to issue orders.

#### **Shrouded Wings (Standard Keepers, CR 4-5 Agents)**

- The **field agents, assassins, and enforcers** of the Keepers.
- They handle **intelligence gathering, smuggling high-value goods, and eliminating threats.**
- Every Shrouded Wing **knows at least one hidden escape route** out of the city, in case they need to disappear.

---

### **Unique Mechanics for the Keepers of the Feather**

#### **Raven’s Mask (Unique Ability for Harbingers and Above)**

Once per day, a Keeper can **use their Raven’s Mask to see through lies.** For the next **10 minutes**, they have **Advantage on Insight checks**, and any **Deception checks against them are rolled at Disadvantage.**

#### **Mark of the Last Flight (Assassination Mechanic, CR 5+)**

- Once a **Keeper marks a target**, they **cannot escape.**
- If the target **leaves the city, the Keeper will find them**—even if it takes years.
- The only way to stop the Mark is through **a secret ritual involving raven’s blood, silver, and a confession.**

#### **Side Mission 1: "The Ledger of Broken Wings" (Blackmail Mission with Lydia Vallakovich)**

_"Some secrets should never see the light of day. Unfortunately for Lydia Vallakovich, the wrong people found hers."_

##### **Mission Hook:**

The Keepers of the Feather have uncovered a **ledger** containing **damning evidence** about _Vargas Vallakovich’s corrupt dealings, secret murders, and connections to dark entities_. The problem? **Lydia Vallakovich has it.**

##### **Why Lydia Has the Ledger:**

- Lydia, **fed up with Vargas’ paranoia and cruelty**, has secretly been **preparing to flee the city with her son**.
- She found the ledger **hidden in a safe** within the **Vallakovich Mansion**, detailing **every crime her husband has committed**—including **several dealings with eldritch cultists.**
- She plans to **use it as leverage** to secure her escape, but **she doesn’t realize just how many people want it destroyed.**

##### **The Keepers' Request:**

The players are hired by the Keepers to **retrieve the ledger before it falls into the wrong hands.** Their instructions:

- **Get the ledger.**
- **Do not harm Lydia unless absolutely necessary.**
- **Ensure no one else gets their hands on it.**

##### **Complications:**

1. **Lydia is no fool**—she has the ledger **hidden somewhere secret**, and she has **bribed a Vallakovich enforcer** to help her escape.
2. **Vargas has caught wind of her plan** and has sent **his own men to intercept her.**
3. **A third party, the Wachter Family, also wants the ledger**, believing it contains **evidence that could ruin the Vallakovich crime syndicate.**

##### **Possible Outcomes:**

- The players retrieve the ledger and deliver it to the Keepers, who **use it as leverage over Vargas Vallakovich**.
- Lydia **escapes the city**, possibly becoming an **NPC contact** or a **dangerous liability.**
- If the players **fail**, the ledger might end up in **Lady Fiona Wachter’s hands**, triggering a **power struggle** between crime families.

#### **Side Mission 2: "The Traitor’s Last Flight" (Hunting a Rogue Keeper)**

_"A Keeper of the Feather is never truly free. The only way out is the fall."_

##### **Mission Hook:**

A **former Keeper of the Feather**, known only as _The Hollow Beak_, has **gone rogue**. He has been **selling family secrets** to **the Wachters and Vallakoviches** and **plans to leave the city tonight.**

##### **Why the Players Are Involved:**

- The Keepers know that if _Hollow Beak_ escapes, **decades of secrets will be lost**.
- However, because he **was once one of them**, the Keepers **cannot be seen handling this matter personally**—which is where the players come in.
- They must **track him down and silence him before dawn**.

##### **Where the Traitor Is Hiding:**

- He is **holed up in an old speakeasy**, **guarded by hired muscle**.
- He has **ripped out his black feather tattoo**, symbolizing his betrayal.
- He has **a sealed letter** addressed to an unknown party—if found, it could reveal **what he has been planning.**

##### **Challenges:**

1. _Hollow Beak_ was a **master of espionage** and **knows every trick in the book**.
2. He has **planted false leads** and **fake documents** to throw off pursuers.
3. If given a chance, he will **attempt to manipulate the players**, claiming he was **forced out** and that the Keepers are hiding even darker secrets.

##### **Possible Outcomes:**

- If the players **kill him**, the Keepers **reward them** and **burn all evidence** that he ever existed.
- If the players **spare him**, he may become **a recurring NPC**, feeding them **forbidden knowledge about the Keepers and the Martikovs.**
- If the players **help him escape**, they now have **a dangerous fugitive on the run, pursued by the Keepers.**

---

#### **Side Mission 3: "The Feather and the Fang" (A Supernatural Assassination Mission)**

_"Some monsters cannot be killed by bullets alone."_

##### **Mission Hook:**

The Keepers have identified a **powerful supernatural enemy** hiding in the city—a **vampire** who has **infiltrated the Martikov supply chain** and is **sabotaging their bootlegging operations.**

##### **Why the Players Are Involved:**

- The vampire, **known only as Karloff the Smiling**, has proven **too elusive for even the Keepers to kill.**
- **Bullets and knives don’t work on him.**
- He must be dealt with **permanently**, but **killing a vampire requires special means.**

##### **Mission Objectives:**

- **Find Karloff’s lair** (a hidden club known as _The Smiling Devil_).
- **Lure him into a vulnerable position.**
- **Destroy him before he disappears again.**

##### **Challenges:**

1. Karloff **feeds off fear and deception**—he knows how to **manipulate those around him.**
2. He has **a cult of devoted followers** who will **die to protect him.**
3. The club is **heavily guarded**, and starting a fight could **spark a war between the crime families.**

##### **Possible Outcomes:**

- If the players **kill Karloff**, the Keepers **reward them with rare weapons and eldritch knowledge.**
- If Karloff **escapes**, he will **return as a recurring villain, now aware of the players.**
- If the players **negotiate with Karloff**, they may **learn more about Strahd’s connection to the Elder God**—but at a dangerous price.

## **Martikov Family Mobsters – The Smugglers in the Shadows**

The **Martikov crime family** thrives on **bootlegging, smuggling, and black-market dealings.** They control **the flow of illegal alcohol, rare contraband, and stolen goods** throughout the city, operating out of a **network of speakeasies and hidden warehouses.** Unlike the brutal tactics of the Vallakovich or Wachter families, the Martikovs are **subtle, favoring deception, espionage, and blackmail over outright violence.**

However, what **truly** sets them apart is their **bloodline curse**—every member of the family is a **wereraven.** They use their **shape-shifting abilities** to stay ahead of their enemies, **passing unseen messages**, **spying on rivals**, and **vanishing before the law can catch them.**

#### **[[CR3 Wereraven]]**
#### **[[CR3 Martikov Smuggler]]**
#### **[[CR4 Martikov Enforcer]]**

## **Quest Ideas for the Martikov Family**

---

#### **1. Investigate and Deal with Werewolf Sabotage**

**Quest Hook**: The Martikov family has been under attack from a rival group of werewolves who are jealous of the Wereravens’ business. The family believes the werewolves are trying to drive them out of business or sabotage their product. The party is asked to investigate these attacks and either neutralize the werewolves or sabotage their operations in retaliation.

- **Objectives**:
    
    - Investigate the source of the attacks, uncovering where the werewolves are hiding and how they are getting inside the Martikovs' business (e.g., sabotaging shipments, poisoning the alcohol, or causing physical damage to their facilities).
    - Deal with the werewolves—whether through a direct confrontation, outsmarting them, or finding a way to turn them against each other.
    - If the party uncovers that the werewolves have ties to someone higher up (perhaps a rival mafia family or even Strahd’s agents), they might need to decide whether to expose this connection or act covertly.
- **Outcome**: Successfully resolving this conflict will earn the Martikov family’s trust and favor. The head of the family may still be wary, but the eldest son will see the party as valuable allies. As a reward, the party could receive some of the finest moonshine from the Martikov’s operation, as well as information on other factions or hidden places of power in Barovia.
    

---

#### **2. Fix the Bootlegging Business—Battle Against Evil Druids and Baba Lysaga**

**Quest Hook**: The Martikov family’s bootlegging business is in deep trouble. Evil druids, led by the twisted Baba Lysaga, have stolen magical gems that kept the land fertile for their wine, weakening the entire operation. The gems are now buried at Yester Hill. The Martikov patriarch is unwilling to ask for help, but his son pleads with the party to assist in retrieving the gems and putting an end to the druids’ interference.

- **Objectives**:
    
    - Travel to **Yester Hill**, which has become a cursed place under the druids' influence. The area is overrun with wild, corrupted nature and strange, terrifying creatures.
    - Uncover the truth behind Baba Lysaga's influence on the druids, and deal with her scarecrows or any other monstrous creations she has set in motion.
    - Retrieve the magical gems that are hidden deep within the hill, perhaps in a dangerous, vine-covered temple or the heart of a terrifying druidic circle.
    - Optional: The party may need to confront Baba Lysaga herself, who could be revealed as an agent of a greater power—possibly even Strahd’s, further tying her to the larger lore of the Elder God.
- **Outcome**: By returning the gems to the Martikov family, the party will restore their ability to produce the special alcohol that powers their bootlegging business. The family will become far more receptive to the party, seeing them as trusted allies. They might also provide more information about Strahd, the land, and other key players in Barovia. In addition, the eldest son might even invite the party to become more involved in the family’s business and operations.
    

---

#### **3. A Tension-Filled Meeting: Help Resolve an Internal Family Dispute**

**Quest Hook**: The Martikov family has always had a tense internal dynamic, particularly between the patriarch (head of the family) and the eldest son, who is more sympathetic to outsiders and prefers a more progressive approach to their business. The eldest son asks the party to mediate a delicate meeting where the family must decide whether to ally with Strahd’s forces (for political protection) or remain independent, risking greater instability.

- **Objectives**:
    
    - Serve as neutral mediators in a family dispute. The patriarch wants to maintain their independence and avoid any deeper involvement with Strahd’s power. The eldest son, however, believes that striking a deal with Strahd could provide long-term protection and greater power.
    - The party may need to negotiate, gather additional information, or perhaps even sway other family members to one side.
    - If the party leans toward the eldest son’s perspective, they could uncover Strahd’s secret ambitions and give the family insight into potential ways of navigating these dangerous waters without becoming beholden to Strahd.
    - Alternatively, the party could advise the patriarch to reject any alliances with Strahd, which may incur Strahd’s wrath and prompt the family to prepare for a major conflict.
- **Outcome**: Depending on how the mediation goes, the family dynamic might shift. The party can either solidify an alliance with Strahd or find a way for the family to remain independent (with Strahd’s agents likely taking notice). If they help the eldest son prevail, the Martikov family will view them as significant allies. The family may also provide access to new resources, knowledge of Strahd’s inner circle, or even a safe haven for the party if needed.
    

---

#### **4. Smuggling Operation in Peril**

**Quest Hook**: The Martikov family’s bootlegging operation is under pressure from rival factions or law enforcement. Strahd’s agents or the Vallakovich Family may be trying to shut them down. The party is asked to help protect or smuggle a shipment of alcohol to a safe location.

- **Objectives**:
    
    - Escort or protect a shipment of Martikov alcohol from the winery to a hidden location in Vallaki, dealing with obstacles along the way.
    - Face off against ambushes from Strahd’s agents or rival factions (such as a rival mafia family or bandits).
    - The party might have to use their wits to evade detection by law enforcement or other dangerous individuals, relying on stealth and quick thinking.
- **Outcome**: Successfully protecting the shipment ensures that the Martikov family’s operation survives, and the family will owe the party a debt of gratitude. They may reward the party with high-end alcohol (which could have special properties) or other resources like access to hidden places or trade routes.
    

---

### **Expanded Version of the Wizard of Wines:**

To make this fit the updated tone of your campaign, here are some adjustments:

- **Baba Lysaga’s Influence**: Baba Lysaga is now a powerful druid with a twisted connection to Strahd’s inner circle. She is using her magic to corrupt the land around the winery, draining its life force. The magical gems are tied to this power, and the druids have become her agents of decay.
- **Yester Hill**: Yester Hill is now a cursed, twisted place that is home to an ancient druidic circle. The druids have become corrupted by their pact with Baba Lysaga and seek to use the hill’s magic to control the land around the winery.
- **Scarecrows**: The scarecrows now serve as guardians of the corrupted land around Yester Hill and the winery, acting as protectors of the dark magic that has been unleashed.

The party will need to face not just Baba Lysaga’s minions, but perhaps even corrupted forest spirits, vengeful spirits of past druids, or horrific creatures tied to nature’s decay as they uncover the true scope of the evil that threatens the Martikovs' business.

---

### **Final Outcome of the Martikov Family Quest Line:**

Once the party helps the Martikov family by solving the issues surrounding their bootlegging business, the Wereravens will become much more supportive. The patriarch will likely still be wary but will grudgingly respect the party for their work. The eldest son will likely see them as true allies, and they may even ask the party for help in their future dealings with Strahd or rival factions.

The Martikov family will be incredibly loyal, offering their assistance in future endeavors, whether through safe haven, insider information, or resources. If the party chooses to help them further, the family may even be drawn into the larger struggle against Strahd, creating an alliance that could shift the power balance in Barovia.
