**"Subjects"â€”former humans surgically altered, drugged, and driven insane.**

- Former **criminals, political dissidents, and patients** subjected to **surgical horrors**.
- Some have **animal parts grafted onto them**, others **strange mutations**, **stitched skin**, or **involuntary muscle spasms** from failed procedures.
- Many are **drugged to keep them docile**, but some **retain their minds and want revenge**.

The Afflicted that infest the abbey are all criminals, political dissidents, and patients sent there by [[_The Church of the Eternal Light]] and all suffer from some form of madness. Whenever the characters interact with an Afflicted roll on the Indefinite [[Madness]] table or choose from the available options on the table to determine how that particular Afflicted's madness is expressed. Most of the Afflicted in the abbey are locked up because they can't be trusted to wander about unsupervised.
