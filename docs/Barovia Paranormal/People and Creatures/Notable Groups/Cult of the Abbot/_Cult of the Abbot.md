## **Krezk Valley** - [[St. Markovia Sanitorium]]

### Key Members
- [[The Abbot]]
- [[The Afflicted]]

### **The Cult of The Abbott**
### **Cult of the Abbot Hierarchy**

- **The Abbot**: A once holy figure, now entirely consumed by his twisted vision. He believes he is creating "perfect" beings that will ascend in the eyes of the Elder God. He remains outwardly calm but is utterly mad.
- **The Firstborn**: The earliest [[CR0.25 Mongrelfolk]] creations, who are fiercely loyal to the Abbot. They act as enforcers, ensuring the other Mongrelfolk remain obedient.
- **The Choir**: A small group of Mongrelfolk who retain beautiful voices despite their monstrous forms. They sing eerie hymns at the Abbey, believing it pleases the Elder God.
- **The Caretakers**: Mongrelfolk assigned to oversee the Abbey's many monstrous inhabitants, some of whom have lost their minds completely.
- **The Unfinished**: Failed experiments that are barely functional beings, often violent and unpredictable.

### **Interactions with Other Factions**

- **The Packhounds (Werewolves)**: They see the Mongrelfolk as abominations and sometimes hunt them. However, some Mongrelfolk have escaped and sought refuge among the Packhounds.
- **The Martikov Family (Wereravens)**: The Martikovs view the Abbot as a terrible threat, though they avoid direct conflict. They have tried to warn others of the Abbey's horrors.
- **The Silver Order**: If the Order discovers the Abbot’s work, they may consider it an affront to nature and a corruption that must be cleansed.
- **The Drowned Circle**: While both serve the Elder God, the Yesterhill cultists see the Abbot’s work as misguided. They do not openly oppose him, but they do not consider the Mongrelfolk sacred.
- **The Zarovich Family (Strahd’s Agents)**: Strahd is aware of the Abbot’s madness but finds it amusing rather than threatening. He may even occasionally send spies to observe the Abbot’s work.

| d12 | Encounter                    | Description                                                                                                                                                 | Mechanics                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **The Choir’s Hymn**         | The eerie, discordant voices of the Choir echo through the valley. Their song is unsettling yet oddly beautiful.                                            | Any creature that listens for more than 1 minute must make a **DC 14 Wisdom save** or suffer **disadvantage on Wisdom checks** for 1 hour due to creeping unease.                                      |
| 2   | **The Firstborn’s Patrol**   | A group of 3 Mongrelfolk enforcers (MM) led by a **Firstborn Abomination** (custom stat block) patrols the roads. They are looking for escaped experiments. | If combat occurs, the Firstborn fights ferociously, gaining **advantage on attacks when below half HP**.                                                                                               |
| 3   | **The Unfinished Escape**    | A twisted, half-formed Mongrelfolk has escaped the Abbey, wailing in pain and madness. It attacks anything that moves.                                      | The creature starts with **2 levels of exhaustion** but has **Berserker Rage** (gains an extra attack if below half HP).                                                                               |
| 4   | **Surgical Disposal**        | The party stumbles across a pile of discarded body parts from failed experiments. Some still twitch unnaturally.                                            | Investigating the pile requires a **DC 13 Medicine or Arcana check** to determine they were grafted using unnatural means. Disturbing the pile causes **1d4 Crawling Claws (MM)** to animate.          |
| 5   | **A Strange Beggar**         | A cloaked figure with mismatched limbs begs for food and shelter. If aided, they whisper warnings about the Abbot’s plans.                                  | If the party follows up, they can uncover a **secret passage** into the Abbey with a **DC 14 Persuasion check**.                                                                                       |
| 6   | **Nighttime Horror**         | As the party rests, distant shrieks echo through the streets of Krezk. A Mongrelfolk hunting party is dragging a villager toward the Abbey.                 | If intervened, the Mongrelfolk release the villager but call for reinforcements (1d4+1 more Mongrelfolk arrive in 3 rounds).                                                                           |
| 7   | **Blessing of the Abbot**    | A grotesquely altered monk offers the party a “blessing” in the name of the Abbot, trying to mark them for transformation.                                  | If accepted, the target must make a **DC 15 Constitution save** or suffer a **random minor mutation** (e.g., glowing eyes, an extra finger, slightly elongated limbs).                                 |
| 8   | **The Caretakers’ Errand**   | A Mongrelfolk disguised as a normal traveler asks the party to retrieve a stolen “sacred relic” (actually an escaped experiment) from the Martikovs.        | The Martikovs refuse to return it, believing it’s a cursed abomination. The party must choose sides.                                                                                                   |
| 9   | **The Flesh Market**         | The party comes across a **black market dealing in body parts and grafts** for those who wish to be “improved.” A surgeon offers them “enhancements.”       | Accepting an enhancement requires a **DC 16 Constitution save**. On success, gain a **+1 bonus to a physical stat** for 24 hours. On failure, suffer **1 level of exhaustion** and mild disfigurement. |
| 10  | **A Whisper from the Abbey** | A villager warns the party that the Abbot has taken an interest in them and may send Mongrelfolk to abduct them in their sleep.                             | That night, roll a **DC 15 Perception check** to detect intruders before **1d4 Mongrelfolk** attempt to kidnap a party member.                                                                         |
| 11  | **The Abbot’s Sermon**       | A procession of Mongrelfolk parades through the valley, chanting praises to the Elder God. The Abbot himself leads the march.                               | Observing the sermon grants insight into the cult’s beliefs, but failing a **DC 14 Wisdom save** causes **1 level of short-term madness (DMG rules)** due to the horrifying implications.              |
| 12  | **The Abbot’s Invitation**   | A messenger from the Abbey delivers a formal invitation for the party to visit the Abbot. Whether this is an honor or a trap is unclear.                    | If the party accepts, they are treated as guests—**for now**. Leaving the Abbey without permission could be difficult.                                                                                 |
