### üìñ CORE TENETS

These are the spiritual pillars every follower learns and recites. They sound virtuous on the surface, but are chillingly strict in practice.

|#|Tenet|Interpretation|
|---|---|---|
|1|**Light is Truth; Darkness is Deceit**|All that hides in shadow is suspect. Secrets are sins, and confession is sacred.|
|2|**To Doubt is to Invite the Dark**|Questioning the Church‚Äôs doctrine is treated as a gateway to madness and heresy.|
|3|**Purity Must Be Preserved**|Any trace of ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù ‚Äî deformity, magical taint, dreamwalking, or emotional instability ‚Äî must be cleansed.|
|4|**All Things Are Seen by the Light**|Surveillance and informants are holy acts. The faithful are encouraged to report suspicious behavior, even within families.|
|5|**The Flame Must Be Fed**|Sacrifice (spiritual, symbolic, or literal) is necessary to preserve the balance and keep the Light burning.|
|6|**Dreams are Doors to Madness**|The Church despises the Dreaming (as used by the Vistani Dreamwalkers). Dreamers are watched or detained.|
|7|**Only the Anointed May Speak with the Light**|Magic not granted by the Church is heresy. Miracles are ‚ÄúLight-given,‚Äù and all other magic is infernal.|

### ‚õìÔ∏è LAWS OF THE CHURCH

These are the rules enforced by its Inquisitors and clergy. Breaking these may lead to confession, penance, imprisonment, or purging.

| Law                               | Description                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blasphemy**                     | Speaking against the Church, its high clergy, or sacred texts is punishable by excommunication or worse.                      |
| **Witchcraft**                    | Unauthorized use of magic, even healing or illusions, is forbidden. Those who wield such power must register and be tested.   |
| **Heretical Artifacts**           | Possession of relics, books, or objects not sanctified by the Church is grounds for arrest. This includes old Barovian idols. |
| **Association with the Dreaming** | Contact with Dreamwalkers, psychics, or users of astral magic is outlawed. Dream manipulation is seen as soul-tampering.      |
| **Obstruction of Light**          | Preventing Inquisitors or Lightwardens from investigating a location or person is treated as aiding darkness.                 |
| **Unholy Burial**                 | All dead must be purified and burned in the Light. Interring bodies or using necromantic rites is deeply taboo.               |
| **Bloodline Taint**               | Children of heretics or mages may be taken for Church inspection. Some are ‚Äúcleansed,‚Äù others vanish.                         |

### üåë INTERACTION WITH THE ELDRITCH

While the Church claims to fight against the void and protect humanity, you've hinted at an ironic or dark twist:

- **Possibility 1**: The Eternal Light is not holy at all ‚Äî it's just another alien force, masquerading as divine to manipulate humanity.
- **Possibility 2**: The Church is _unknowingly_ being used by the Stranger (or another cosmic entity) as a buffer ‚Äî keeping more curious minds from discovering real truths.
- **Possibility 3**: The Church actively fights the Stranger and Dreamwalkers because they _know_ what lies beyond and fear it will unravel reality.

---

### üß† THEMES

- **Control vs. Freedom** (especially psychic/spiritual freedom)
- **Corruption in Holy Institutions**
- **Paranoia and Witch-Hunting**
- **Forbidden Knowledge**
- **Cosmic Horror as a Rationale for Dogma**

## General Populace Opinions About the Church (Citywide)

#### **Positive Views**

Many regular citizens‚Äîespecially those with few options‚Äîsee the Church of the Eternal Light as a **source of hope and stability** in a city filled with shadows, corruption, and strange disappearances. Its teachings on spiritual purity and eternal peace offer **comfort** to the grieving, the lost, and the fearful. This is especially true for:

- **The elderly** who‚Äôve lost loved ones.
- **The poor or desperate** who find shelter, food, or meaning through church programs.
- **The sick or addicted**, whom the Church sometimes offers to ‚Äúheal‚Äù (whether through prayer, potions, or purging rituals).

Some folks genuinely believe the Church **protects them from darker forces**‚Äîthings like demonic possession, curses, hauntings, or the ‚Äúplague of dreams‚Äù whispered about in certain districts.

#### **Skeptical or Neutral Views**

Others view the Church more like a **powerful bureaucracy** or **weird social club**. It‚Äôs part of the city‚Äôs structure, like law enforcement or the postal service‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt think about until it shows up on your doorstep.

Many citizens just go through the motions: attending major holy days, lighting candles for the dead, or tossing a coin into the donation bowl ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù There‚Äôs some social pressure to be seen respecting the Church, even if belief is lukewarm.

### **Class**
#### **Rich, High-Class**
- The Church is seen as **respectable and prestigious**, almost like an elite club or old-money institution.
- Attending sermons or donating to the Church is a **status symbol**.
- Residents believe the Church has their best interests at heart and trust it to keep ‚Äúunpleasant elements‚Äù at bay‚Äîwhether that means spirits or the poor.
- Some aristocrats even **hide secrets behind piety**, using the Church as cover for darker dealings.

#### **Middle-Class, Respectable**
- The Church is **respected**, even if people aren‚Äôt overtly devout.  
- It's seen as a **moral authority** and a symbol of tradition and order.
- Families might send children to Church-run schools or request blessings for weddings, funerals, and business ventures.
- There‚Äôs a feeling that ‚Äúgood people go to church,‚Äù even if it's more social than spiritual.

#### **Working-Class, Diverse**
- Opinions are **split**.
    - Some working-class folks see the Church as a **lifeline**: free food, job referrals, or protection from hauntings.
    - Others are **wary**, seeing it as a front for judgmental zealotry or something out of touch with daily struggle.
- Preachers on street corners are more common, and **small urban shrines** might dot the area, maintained by locals who mix Eternal Light practices with folk traditions.

#### **Lower-Class, Marginalized**
- The Church is **distrusted or ignored** in these districts.
    - Many see it as a **tool of the elite** or as uncaring toward their plight.
    - Church patrols may be rare, and when they do appear, it‚Äôs often to **investigate something ominous**‚Äînot to help.
- Locals rely more on **folk rituals**, **sea gods**, or **ancestral spirits**, sometimes blending these with Eternal Light traditions in ways the Church disapproves of.

#### **Shadow cults**
- Here, the Church is often viewed as **irrelevant or dangerous**.
    - The supernatural is more openly acknowledged, and many see the Church as too weak‚Äîor too proud‚Äîto handle the real threats.
- Others believe the Church **knows more than it says**, hoarding power and artifacts in secret.
- Fringe groups may even consider the Church **complicit** in Barovia's curse.

## How the Church Engages with the Populace
- **Public Ceremonies & Vigils:** Lantern processions, blessings of the dead, or seasonal feasts held in parks or open squares.
- **Alms & Outreach:** Soup kitchens, spiritual counseling, and education programs in lower districts‚Äîoften manned by younger acolytes or reformed zealots.
- **Sanctuary Rights:** Church buildings offer sanctuary from both legal prosecution and supernatural forces. Some criminals and victims alike hide in church basements.
- **Confessionals & ‚ÄúPurification‚Äù Services:** Some people visit to confess dark thoughts or strange dreams. Others seek rites to ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù them from unknown spiritual corruption.
- **Subtle Surveillance:** Priests gather **information under the guise of spiritual concern**. In wealthier areas, this is about influence. In poorer ones, it's more about containment.

| -------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | **The Purifiers' Raid**       | A group of Purifiers storm a hidden speakeasy, smashing barrels and dragging patrons into the streets for public shaming. A priest begins a loud sermon about purity and redemption.         | If the party is inside, they must make a **DC 15 Stealth check** to escape unnoticed. Otherwise, they can intervene or watch the chaos unfold.                                                             |
| **2**    | **Suspicious Priest**         | A nervous low-ranking priest meets secretly with a Martikov bootlegger in a quiet alley. He seems to be exchanging coded messages or money.                                                  | If the party eavesdrops (**DC 14 Perception**), they learn that some priests are selling confiscated alcohol back to the black market.                                                                     |
| **3**    | **Public Trial**              | A man is shackled to a wooden post in the square. A cleric accuses him of "moral corruption" and demands he renounce his past sins. The man is panicked, and his family pleads for mercy.    | The party can intervene or let the trial play out. If they interfere, the **Purifiers become hostile** unless persuaded (**DC 16 Persuasion**).                                                            |
| **4**    | **Whispers from the Witches** | A veiled woman in a dark cloak approaches the party, offering them a deal: "The Church wants control, but we have true freedom‚Ä¶ take this." She tries to hand them a vial of strange liquid. | Drinking it forces a **DC 15 Constitution save**. On failure, the drinker experiences disturbing visions related to the **Witch Coven**. On success, they hear eerie whispers revealing Church corruption. |
| **5**    | **Investigator's Warning**    | A city law officer pulls the party aside. "You didn't hear this from me, but‚Ä¶ stop digging into the Church. People disappear that way."                                                      | The party can press for more details (**DC 14 Persuasion**). On failure, the officer refuses to say more.                                                                                                  |
| **6**    | **A "Reformed" Drunkard**     | A man wearing Church robes preaches in the streets, claiming he was saved from alcohol by the Eternal Light. He stares at the party with glassy eyes, almost unnaturally devout.             | **Detect Magic** reveals faint traces of **Enchantment** magic on him. He might be brainwashed, but confronting him could draw Church attention.                                                           |
| **7**    | **The Cult of the Sea Stirs** | Two hooded figures‚Äîmembers of the **Eldritch Cult**‚Äîdeface a Church mural with strange sigils. When spotted, they flee toward the sea, whispering, "The Light dims before the Deep‚Ä¶"         | Chasing them requires a **DC 15 Athletics check**. On success, the party catches them before they disappear into a hidden passage.                                                                         |
| **8**    | **Silver Order's Scorn**      | A revenant knight of the **Silver Order** lingers near a Church outpost, watching with barely contained rage. He mutters, "They betrayed their own cause long ago‚Ä¶"                          | If the party speaks with him, he reveals that the **Church once opposed Strahd but now serves his goals**. If convinced (**DC 17 Persuasion**), he may reveal a hidden archive within the Church.          |
| **9**    | **An Unholy Sermon**          | The party stumbles upon a hidden underground sermon. The High Cleric speaks in a **dark, otherworldly voice**, twisting the Church‚Äôs doctrine. The congregation listens, entranced.          | A **DC 16 Insight check** reveals that the priest is **possessed**. If the party tries to intervene, the crowd may become violent.                                                                         |
| **10**   | **Brutal Enforcement**        | A shopkeeper accused of selling wine illegally is dragged from his business by Purifiers. They prepare to brand him with the Church‚Äôs sigil as punishment.                                   | The party can intervene (combat or persuasion **DC 18**) or let the branding occur, which may cause unrest in the district.                                                                                |

Instead of religious goods, barrels of **contraband alcohol** are unloaded under armed guard.                                  | If the party investigates, they can uncover evidence of the **Church‚Äôs hypocrisy**. A **DC 15 Stealth check** allows them to watch unnoticed.                                                              |
| **12**   | **The High Cleric‚Äôs Orders**  | A letter is nailed to a city notice board, signed by a high-ranking cleric. It calls for "righteous citizens" to **inform on their neighbors** suspected of drinking or vice.                | The party can trace the letter‚Äôs origin, leading to a bureaucratic nightmare‚Äîor a deeper conspiracy within the Church.                                                                                     |
