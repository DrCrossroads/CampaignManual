### **Traits**

**Adamantine Body.** Critical hits against the Guardian are treated as normal hits.

**Superheated Core.** Any creature that hits the Guardian with a melee attack takes **7 (2d6) fire damage**. Additionally, at the start of each of the Guardian’s turns, it radiates **aura heat** in a **10-foot radius**, dealing **10 (3d6) fire damage** to any creature that starts its turn within range.

**Magical Warding.** The Forge Guardian is immune to **dispel magic** and automatically succeeds on saving throws against magical effects that would alter its form (such as polymorph).

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** The Guardian makes two **Smashing Fist** attacks.

**Smashing Fist.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
Hit: **19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage** plus **7 (2d6) fire damage**.

**Molten Burst (Recharge 5–6).** The Guardian releases a burst of molten slag in a **15-foot radius**. Each creature in that area must make a **DC 16 Dexterity saving throw**, taking **21 (6d6) fire damage** on a failure, or half as much on a success. Flammable objects ignite.

**Overheat (Recharge 6).** The Guardian overloads its core, causing its **Superheated Core** damage to increase to **21 (6d6) fire damage** for 1 minute. While overheated, it has **disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws**.
