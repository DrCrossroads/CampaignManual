## **Final Boss Mechanics – The False God Encounter**

This fight should feel **mythic and cinematic**, forcing players to adapt as the **False God shifts forms** and **alters the battlefield**.

---

## **📍 Phase 1: The Idol of Light (Divine Manifestation)**

**The False God starts as an enormous, angelic figure—haloed, six-winged, and wreathed in golden light. It appears like a celestial savior but is utterly malevolent.**

### **🌟 Phase 1 Mechanics:**

- **Worship’s Power (Lair Action, 1/round):** If **three or more creatures** are charmed by the False God, it **heals 50 HP** at the start of its turn.
- **Blinding Radiance (Recharge 4-6):** **All creatures in a 30-ft radius** must make a **DC 18 Constitution save** or take **6d10 radiant damage** and be **blinded for 1 minute**.
- **Chains of Submission (Recharge 5-6):** Summons **three spectral chains** that seek to bind the party. **Each chain targets a separate creature** (DC 17 Strength save or be restrained). If all **three chains** succeed, the **entire party is stunned for one round** as the False God "accepts their offering."
- **Legendary Action: Divine Wrath (2 Actions):** A beam of **golden fire** targets **one creature** (range: 120 ft.), dealing **8d10 radiant and fire damage** (DC 18 Dex save for half).
- **Divine Collapse (50% HP Transition Move):** The False God shatters its own divine form, causing **the ceiling of the Sanctum to rupture**. All creatures must make a **DC 18 Dex save** or **fall into the abyss below**—landing in the Rift Chamber, where Phase 2 begins.

---

## **📍 Phase 2: The Hollowed One (Eldritch Horror Form)**

**Now in its true form, the False God is a mass of shifting flesh, cracked halos, and dozens of abyssal eyes. Its golden glow has turned into writhing shadows that twist reality.**

### **🕷️ Phase 2 Mechanics:**

- **Faith's Remnants (Environmental Hazard):** Throughout the room, **floating, broken holy symbols** manifest. Players can **shatter them (DC 15 Attack Roll)** to weaken the False God. **For every two symbols destroyed, it loses a Legendary Action.**
- **Sermon of Madness (Recharge 5-6):** **All creatures who can hear the False God** must make a **DC 19 Wisdom save** or suffer **short-term madness for 1 minute**.
- **Unmaking Touch (Recharge 4-6):** A **twisting appendage strikes out**, dealing **8d12 psychic and necrotic damage**. If a creature is **below 50 HP**, they must make a **DC 17 Con save or be permanently disintegrated**, leaving only their holy symbol behind.
- **Reality Fracture (Lair Action, 1/round):** The False God **unravels a part of the battlefield**, causing **gravity to shift** and **portals to appear**. Players may have to fight **upside down**, phase through walls, or avoid falling into **a burning afterlife.**
- **Legendary Action: Paradox Pulse (1 Action):** A wave of **time-distorting energy** forces **one random creature** to make a **DC 18 Charisma save** or **repeat their last turn in reverse**, undoing actions and causing **1d12 psychic damage per action reversed**.
- **Final Collapse (0 HP Transition Move):** When reduced to 0 HP, the False God **lets out an unholy wail**, triggering an **apocalyptic collapse of the entire Sanctum**. The party **must escape within 3 rounds** or be buried under divine ruins.

## **🛡️ Ways to Weaken the False God Before the Fight**

If players **properly prepare**, they can **nerf** certain mechanics to **turn the tide in battle.**

- **📖 Destroy Forbidden Texts (Library):**  
    _The False God’s power is tied to ancient scriptures in the Library of Forbidden Tomes. If the players burn these texts, the False God **loses its “Sermon of Madness” ability.**_
- **🔭 Unravel Its Sight (Observatory):**  
    _In the Observatory of Unblinking Eyes, the False God’s many eyes are inscribed on celestial maps. If the players deface the maps, the False God **loses its ability to use “Paradox Pulse.”**_
- **🌌 Sever Its Anchor (Rift Chamber):**  
    _The Rift Chamber contains the **God's last tether to reality**. If players disrupt the magical runes here, the False God **loses its ability to regenerate from charmed creatures**._
