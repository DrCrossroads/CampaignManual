##### *Informant*

- **Occupation:** Mechanic & Paranormal Gadgeteer
- **Affiliations:** Formerly worked with a secret government agency studying the supernatural. Now runs an auto shop that specializes in _very_ customized equipment.
- **Persona:** A gruff, no-nonsense man with grease-stained hands and a mind full of secrets, Rust doesn’t talk much—but when he does, it’s worth listening to. He’s one of the few people in the city who actually believes in what the party is doing, but he’ll never admit it outright. Instead, he supplies them with modified vehicles, “experimental” equipment, and the occasional tip about strange happenings in the underbelly of Barovia City.
- **Appearance:** Broad-shouldered, late 40s, salt-and-pepper beard. Always smells like motor oil and cigarettes. Wears a leather apron over his work clothes, with a wrench tucked behind his ear.
- **Methods:**
    - Provides discreet modifications to the party’s gear, no questions asked.
    - Keeps an ear to the ground on supernatural happenings and shady government projects.
    - Has a network of informants in the industrial district who report unusual activity.
- **Secret Weakness:** He has a daughter who vanished under _very_ suspicious circumstances years ago, and he’s still hunting for answers.
