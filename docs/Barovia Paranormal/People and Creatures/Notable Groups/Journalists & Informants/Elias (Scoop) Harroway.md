- **Occupation:** Investigative Journalist for _The Barovia Bulletin_
- **Persona:** Elias Harroway sets himself up as a relentless skeptic and professional heckler, acting as if he is convincing others that the so-called ‚Äúparanormal investigators‚Äù running around Barovia City are frauds, con artists, or dangerously deluded and that he has made it his mission to expose their ‚Äúhoaxes‚Äù to the public, writing scathing articles that mock their exploits and attempt to debunk supernatural claims with hard logic, science, and biting sarcasm.
  In reality, he is a cosmic being slightly bored with the happenings of Barovia and is mischievous.

- **Appearance:** 
	- **The Chronicler Outside Time**
	A tall, wiry man leans casually against a lamppost that wasn't there a moment ago, flipping shut a leather-bound notebook with pages that ripple like water. His pinstripe vest and bowtie seem both dated and timeless, his polished shoes untouched by the grime around them. His smile is knowing, not smug‚Äîlike he‚Äôs already read the next chapter and found it delightful.

    Perched on his nose are round, gold-rimmed spectacles that shimmer with starscapes instead of lenses. His fountain pen, clutched like a dagger, drips not with ink, but with _possibility_‚Äîthe shimmering potential of unwritten futures. Around him, the air wavers slightly, as if reality itself is being edited in real time.

    When he speaks, his voice carries the resonance of a radio broadcast echoing across decades. You feel it not just in your ears, but in your memories‚Äîhalf-formed impressions of things you haven‚Äôt done yet, _but might._

    >"Smile for the byline, heroes. Or villains. Or‚Ä¶ somewhere in between. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll find the angle. I always do."

    He‚Äôs more than a man, less than a god, and exactly what the moment demands.

	- **The Editorial End**
	The air ripples as Elias lifts his head, no longer the amused chronicler but the _author of truth itself_. His notebook floats beside him, its pages flipping with violent intensity‚Äîbleeding glowing red ink that sears into the ground like spilled fire. The pen in his hand has grown jagged and quill-like, carved from the bone of some long-dead, forgotten god.

	His spectacles crack down the center, revealing not eyes, but twin spirals of ink-black galaxies‚Äî_watching_, rewriting, erasing.

	The air thickens with the weight of possibility collapsing. You feel past choices distort, the certainty of memory erode. Time slows, stutters, and then resumes at his command. Words crawl from his mouth before he speaks them‚Äînarration leaking into existence like an ancient prophecy written in real time.

	>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs revise, shall we? You win too often. The blade should have broken. That fireball was too convenient. Let‚Äôs fix the narrative.‚Äù

	Reality bends underfoot. Initiative becomes suggestion. Cause and effect fray like old parchment. You‚Äôre no longer in a battle‚Äîyou‚Äôre in a **draft**, and Elias has just picked up the red pen.

	- **The Last Line of Elias Harroway**
	When the dust settles and silence returns, so too does the page.

	His notebook lies where he fell‚Äîclosed, untouched by ash or blood. Its binding is unbroken, yet the name "Elias Harroway" fades from its cover, letter by letter, until only a dash remains. The world breathes again, slightly out of sync‚Äîas if some great editor has stepped away from their desk mid-revision.

	And then, a voice‚Äînot heard, but _remembered_‚Äîechoes through thought like a well-worn footnote in your own story.

	 >‚ÄúNo story ever really ends. Just new drafts... waiting to be written.‚Äù

	A feathered quill drifts into the wind, trailing ink that never touches the ground. Somewhere, a typewriter clacks without fingers. Somewhere, a book begins to write itself again.

	Whether he was defeated, ascended, or chose to leave‚Äînone can say for certain. Only this remains:  

	Your story continues. But _someone_ is still watching the margins.

- **Methods:**
    - Stalks the party, showing up at the worst times to loudly question their motives.
    - Publishes _‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù_ articles after every major incident, twisting events to paint the party as charlatans.
    - Sabotages their credibility with the police, claiming they tamper with crime scenes.
    - Tries to interview ‚Äúwitnesses‚Äù but selectively edits testimonies to discredit the party.

Elias Harroway is not just a journalist‚Äîhe is a **Narrative Anchor**, a being that exists **outside linear time**, chronicling events as they happen... and sometimes before they do. His quill is not a pen, but a **reality-writing implement**, and his paper isn‚Äôt parchment but a **fragment of the Elder God's Dreaming Scroll**, a metaphysical artifact that shapes **what is remembered‚Äîand therefore, what is real**.

Elias refers to himself as ‚Äúthe reporter of record,‚Äù and in many ways, he is. When something enters the public consciousness through Elias‚Äôs stories, it becomes true. Forgotten moments disappear. Retold moments shift. And those stories are stored not in print, but in the **Chronicle of the Unfolding World**, a massive, invisible book only Elias can see... unless he lets others read from it.

He exists in multiple timelines simultaneously, observing, recording, and occasionally nudging. His ultimate goal? **Document the final fate of this world**‚Äîand be the last witness when the Elder God either awakens or is defeated.

## Interactive Moment: ‚ÄúFront Page News‚Äù

**When to trigger this:** After a major event or when players try to outmaneuver Elias and still find his column beat them to the punch.

**Scene:** The party returns to a safehouse or secluded place, only to find Elias sitting at their table with a steaming cup of coffee, waiting calmly with a smirk.

> _"Gritty stuff out there, huh? I especially liked the part where the paladin hesitated right before striking. Good drama. Don't worry‚ÄîI‚Äôll make sure the readers know you meant well."_  
> He closes a leather-bound notebook, its cover shifting like ink in water.

Elias claims he's here to **interview the players**, offering them a unique deal:

- Answer three questions truthfully, and he‚Äôll write a favorable piece that boosts their renown.
- Lie, and he‚Äôll publish a scathing story instead.
- Attack him, and he warns: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be forced to rewrite your climax. Trust me, you want to stay heroic.‚Äù

This interaction is half roleplay, half social challenge. The players can:

- Try to **negotiate** with Elias for privacy.
- **Question** his motives and identity.
- Attempt to **steal his notebook**, though it vanishes if not willingly given.
- Or even **fight** him.
