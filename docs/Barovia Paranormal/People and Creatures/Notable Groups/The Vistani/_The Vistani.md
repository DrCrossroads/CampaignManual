## **Key Members**
- [[Madame Eva CR 11]] - Secret prophet

## **Dream Walkers**
The Vistani are a secretive, nomadic people who serve the Elder God, believing themselves to be its chosen emissaries. They move through Barovia, speaking in cryptic riddles, offering forbidden knowledge, and whispering promises of power to those who listen. To most, they seem like harmless mystics or merchants, but beneath their charm lies a sinister purpose: they prepare the world for the Elder God's return.

#### **Abilities & Practices**

- **Dreamwalking:** The Vistani can step into dreams, planting nightmares, stealing memories, or manipulating sleepers. Some use this to gather information, while others twist a victim’s mind, leading them to madness.
- **The Gloaming Rituals:** They perform dark ceremonies beneath the moon, calling upon the whispers of the Elder God. Those who witness these rites often wake with fragmented memories and inexplicable dread.
- **The Omen Market:** They trade in more than just goods—they sell glimpses of the future, knowledge from forgotten times, and eldritch blessings. Their fortune-telling is always true, but never complete, ensuring fate is never fully avoided.
- **Agents of Chaos:** They subtly guide events to ensure Strahd’s downfall, but only to free the true master of Barovia: the Elder God. They manipulate the desperate, corrupt the powerful, and steer heroes toward their doom.

#### **How They View Others**

- **The Church of the Eternal Light** – Fools playing at holiness, but a useful distraction. The Vistani infiltrate their ranks, whispering prophecies that drive them to paranoia.
- **The Mafia Families** – A necessary evil. The Vistani barter with them, offering visions of enemies’ secrets in exchange for protection.
- **The Cults & The Silver Order** – Rivals in faith. The Vistani see them as lesser beings, clinging to false gods or dying ideals.
- **The Party** – Pawns in a grand design. The Vistani will aid them, but only as long as it furthers the Elder God’s return.

### **Knowledge and Goals of the Vistani Dreamwalkers**

1. **The Elder God’s Whisperers**: The Vistani Dreamwalkers are not only agents of Strahd but are also tied to an even darker, more primal force: the Elder God. They have access to forbidden knowledge and act as intermediaries between the waking world and the dream realm. This ancient entity whispers through their dreams, guiding their actions and corrupting their motives. They serve not only Strahd’s interests but the interest of freeing the Elder God, using Strahd’s struggle to achieve their ultimate goal.
2. **Prophecies and Manipulation**: These Dreamwalkers have access to visions and dreams of the future, but they are fragmented and cryptic, often full of symbols and disturbing images. They do not see events in a clear, linear manner like other mortals; instead, their prophecies often involve dark, twisted imagery or events that are bound to happen under certain conditions. The Vistani use these visions to subtly guide individuals or groups, either steering them toward doom or revealing certain truths. Their manipulations often have an underlying, malevolent purpose, though they rarely reveal this to their victims.
3. **The Dreamrealm**: The Dreamwalkers have the ability to travel into the dream realm, a twisted reflection of the waking world. Here, they can manipulate the dreams of others—planting nightmares, stealing memories, or even forcing sleepers into lucid dream states to guide them toward certain actions. The boundaries between the dream realm and the waking world are thin in Barovia, and the Vistani are able to pull on the strings of fate from both planes, often altering the course of events in the material world. Some believe that they can shape the future through dreams, bending reality to their will.
4. **A Subtle Role in Barovia**: While they don’t often reveal themselves, the Vistani Dreamwalkers influence many key figures in Barovia. They may have ties to various criminal organizations, secretive cults, or even the ruling elites. Through their manipulation of dreams, they have a hand in influencing Barovia’s many factions, steering events without being directly involved. However, their ultimate goal is to free the Elder God from Strahd’s control and unlock the true power of Barovia.

### **Dreamwalking Mechanics:**

- **Step Into Dreams (Short or Long Rest).** The Vistani can touch a sleeping creature within 30 feet and enter its dreams. They can **implant a nightmare, steal a memory, or manipulate a dream’s course.**
- **Implant Nightmare.** The creature suffers a **DC 12-15 Wisdom save (based on CR)** or wakes up with **1 level of exhaustion** and is **frightened of a chosen image for 1 hour**.
- **Steal Memory.** The creature makes a **DC 12-15 Intelligence save** or forgets a specific event for 24 hours (permanently if failed by 5+). The Vistani learns the memory.
- **Whisper of Madness.** The creature makes a **DC 12-15 Charisma save** or suffers a minor madness effect for **1d4 hours**.

### **Side Effects from Dream Manipulation**

When the Vistani manipulate dreams, it’s not without consequences. Here are some potential side effects:

1. **Lucid Nightmares**: Characters who fall victim to the Vistani’s dreams may experience vivid, disturbing dreams that feel too real. These dreams might cause long-term stress or anxiety, resulting in a penalty to Wisdom saving throws or disadvantage on perception checks when in situations of heightened stress.
2. **Memory Fragments**: Vistani Dreamwalkers can steal fragments of memories or experiences, causing their victims to become confused or uncertain of their own identity. Players might suffer from occasional bouts of amnesia or even lose important memories that they must recover.
3. **Fading Humanity**: Constant exposure to the dream realm or manipulation can lead to a loss of a character’s sense of self. They may become more detached from reality, resulting in a gradual descent into madness. This could manifest as erratic behavior, loss of empathy, or an inability to distinguish between dreams and reality.
4. **Nightmare Manifestations**: Sometimes, the nightmares that the Vistani create manifest in the waking world, causing disturbing visions or even physical manifestations. These could include shadowy figures, strange creatures, or even inanimate objects that seem to move when the character isn’t looking.
5. **Unpredictable Dreamwalkers**: A Vistani Dreamwalker may lose control of the dreams they manipulate, either leading to accidental prophecies that affect the party or introducing darker, uncontrollable elements into the waking world. Players may encounter situations where dream creatures or visions come to life in the material plane.

### **Dream-like Encounters**

To further integrate the Dreamwalkers into your campaign, you can create encounters that have an unsettling, dream-like quality to them. Here are a few ideas:

1. **The Shifting Maze**: The characters enter a location (a dungeon, a mansion, or a forest) and find that it constantly shifts around them, as though they’re in a labyrinth of their own subconscious. Hallways stretch and contract, doors lead to impossible places, and rooms change when they turn their backs. The Vistani may be watching from the shadows, guiding the players into traps or forcing them into certain decisions.
2. **The Mirror of Truth**: The characters encounter an enchanted mirror in the dream realm. When they look into it, they see twisted versions of themselves—versions that represent their darkest fears, desires, or regrets. If the characters engage with these reflections, they may gain insight into their character’s deepest insecurities but also face a penalty to their morale or sanity.
3. **The Silent Festival**: The characters dream of a festival held in a town or village, but it’s eerily quiet. No one speaks, yet everyone is aware of each other’s presence. The characters may witness strange occurrences—like people silently watching them from afar or performing rituals without sound. This encounter could plant seeds of suspicion or dread, leading the characters to question if they’re being watched or manipulated in real life.
4. **The Waking Nightmare**: A character or several characters fall into a deep sleep during their rest, only to wake up inside a nightmare. In the nightmare, they are pursued by a faceless creature that’s intent on hunting them down. Every time they turn around, the creature gets closer. Players must solve riddles or find a way to break out of the nightmare before it becomes real, or risk becoming lost in the dream forever.
5. **The Dreamer’s Deceit**: The characters encounter a Vistani Dreamwalker who gives them cryptic, prophetic advice in their dreams. At first, the advice seems helpful, but later, it becomes clear that it was intentionally misleading. The Dreamwalker’s goal is to set the characters on a dangerous path, possibly leading them into Strahd’s trap or toward the awakening of the Elder God.
