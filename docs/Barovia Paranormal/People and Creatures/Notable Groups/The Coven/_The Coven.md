| d12 | Encounter                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Sweet Temptation**       | A witch sets up a small stall, offering **"Dream Pies"** to passersby. A crowd has already gathered, eagerly buying them. If the party investigates, they see desperate addicts begging for more. A witch may offer the party a free sample – eating a pie requires a **DC 14 Wisdom saving throw**. On a failure, the character becomes **addicted** and suffers **1 level of exhaustion if they go 24 hours without eating another pie**. |
| 2   | **The Bone Wagon**         | A hunched figure pushes a rickety cart covered with a tarp. A **Perception (DC 13)** check reveals small bones poking from beneath the cloth. If confronted, the "vendor" (a disguised witch) hisses and **casts Invisibility** before attempting to escape. If stopped, she may summon **2d4 Shadows** to cover her retreat.                                                                                                               |
| 3   | **Stolen Future**          | A desperate mother sobs in an alley, clutching a doll. She tells the party she sold her child for pies and begs them to get the baby back. She knows the witches visit a house down the street every night. The party can **ambush** the witches or track them back to their hideout.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4   | **Bundle of Woe**          | Three witches walk through the fog, carrying **squirming sacks**. A soft cry escapes one. If the party intervenes, the witches **cast Sleep (5th level)** before attempting to escape. If the party rescues the children, the witches mark them as enemies.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5   | **Sinister Nursery Rhyme** | A group of children sings a disturbing rhyme about the witches taking "bad children" away at night. A **History (DC 12)** check reveals this tale is ancient, and children **vanish every year without a trace**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6   | **The Marked One**         | A random NPC is seen scratching at their skin, whispering, "She’s coming for me." The party witnesses a witch standing in the shadows, **muttering a curse**. If not stopped, the NPC **dies in their sleep that night**. Disrupting the curse forces the witch into a confrontation.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 7   | **Living Nightmare**       | The party wakes up feeling **exhausted** and weak, plagued by horrific dreams of being cooked in a cauldron. **A witch has cursed them in their sleep.** A **Remove Curse** spell can break the effect; otherwise, they suffer **disadvantage on ability checks for the next 24 hours.**                                                                                                                                                    |
| 8   | **The Trade**              | A gaunt man shuffles toward a witch, clutching a small child. He hands the baby over in exchange for a pie. If the party intervenes, he fights them, shrieking about how he "needs just one more taste." The witch laughs and vanishes into the shadows with the child.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9   | **Hexed Goods**            | A disguised witch sells the party a small trinket (a locket, ring, or doll). Within **1d4 hours**, the cursed object **whispers to the wearer in their sleep**, causing **long rests to grant only half the usual benefits**. Removing it requires a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or a **Remove Curse** spell.                                                                                                                             |
| 10  | **Feast in the Dark**      | The party stumbles upon **a hidden gathering of witches** in an abandoned building, **chanting over a cauldron**. Inside the bubbling stew, human bones float. If the witches notice the party, they attempt to trap them inside with **Wall of Fog and Hold Person.**                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11  | **Coven’s Warning**        | A lone witch approaches the party, smiling sweetly. She offers them a deal—**stay out of the coven’s business, and they will not interfere with the party’s fate.** If refused, she **leaves but ensures that one random party member is cursed within 24 hours.**                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12  | **Vanishing Houses**       | The party comes across a home where the entire family has vanished overnight. A **DC 14 Investigation check** finds small claw marks around the doors and windows—**the witches came for them.** Any remaining food in the house is **tainted with magic**, causing hallucinations if eaten.                                                                                                                                                |
