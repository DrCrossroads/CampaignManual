### **The Zarovich Family (Strahd)**

- **Strahd's Empire**: Strahd runs the most powerful crime syndicate in Barovia, focusing on illicit dealings, such as smuggling rare artifacts, blackmailing influential figures, and dealing in blood magic and vampire-related goods. His henchmen are vampires and thralls, giving him a deadly edge. He maintains power through fear and manipulation, controlling both the criminal underworld and the paranormal elements of Barovia.
- **Party Interaction**: Strahd views the party as either a potential threat or as pawns in his game, depending on their influence in Barovia. He may offer them tempting deals to work for him or to investigate specific competitors, all the while weaving webs of deception and setting traps. If they fail or threaten his rule, Strahd will target them personally, using his supernatural abilities to torment and manipulate.
- **Strahd's Influence**: He is subtly behind much of the city's corruption. His influence runs deep, and the party may encounter his agents at every turn.

His view of himself as a tragic savior is fascinating, and having him use the persona of **Chordant Zavir Vosh** to mislead or guide the party is an excellent way to play with the tension of his dual nature. Let's break down how you can subtly hint at his involvement with the Elder God during his interactions with the party while maintaining the air of mystery and manipulation.

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**  | A **charming but unsettling enforcer** approaches the party, offering them a job: deliver a package (likely containing something supernatural) to an unknown recipient. Refusing may lead to threats or later retaliation.                                                      | **Insight (DC 15)** to detect underlying menace. If they refuse, roll **1d4**: (1) warned, (2) threatened, (3) marked as an enemy, (4) attacked later.                                                                                                                   |
| **2**  | A **masked informant** slips the party a cryptic note: _"He is watching."_ Shortly after, a shadow moves unnaturally, and a figure disappears into an alley.                                                                                                                    | **Perception (DC 14)** to catch a glimpse of the figure before they vanish. **Arcana (DC 15)** to recognize subtle supernatural interference.                                                                                                                            |
| **3**  | **A terrified city official** stumbles into the party, whispering frantically about Strahd’s people coming for them. Minutes later, a pair of well-dressed Zarovich operatives (one likely a vampire) arrive, asking if the party has seen their "business associate."          | If the party lies, roll **Deception vs. Insight (DC 16)** for the enforcers. If they fight, roll **1d6**: (1-3) normal enforcers, (4-6) one is a vampire spawn.                                                                                                          |
| **4**  | A **thrall courier collapses in front of the party**, blood dripping from their nose, clutching a strange artifact. They beg the party to “keep it away from him” before dying. Moments later, a suited vampire calmly approaches, asking if they’ve seen someone running past. | **Medicine (DC 12)** reveals signs of blood loss, but no wounds. **Arcana (DC 15)** to identify the artifact’s unnatural properties.                                                                                                                                     |
| **5**  | The party notices a **group of Zarovich enforcers extracting “protection fees”** from a local business. The owner begs the party to intervene—but the enforcers are watching carefully.                                                                                         | **Persuasion (DC 17)** to de-escalate. **Intimidation (DC 18)** to scare off the enforcers. If combat breaks out, roll **1d4**: (1-2) normal enforcers, (3-4) one is a vampire thrall.                                                                                   |
| **6**  | A **lavishly dressed woman or man** invites the party to an exclusive event at "The Lofts," Strahd’s skyscraper. The invitation seems genuine, but the party will be under surveillance the entire time.                                                                        | If they attend, they make **Stealth (DC 16)** or **Deception (DC 18)** checks if they attempt to snoop. Failing means **Strahd is now aware of their interest in him**.                                                                                                  |
| **7**  | **The city shifts strangely around the party**, alleyways looping in impossible ways. A **silver-eyed stranger** watches them from a rooftop before vanishing into the mist. Their **pocket watch bears Strahd’s insignia**.                                                    | **Investigation (DC 15)** to recognize the unnatural warping of reality. **History (DC 14)** to recall tales of Strahd's ability to bend the city to his will.                                                                                                           |
| **8**  | A **familiar face** approaches the party, but something is off—their movements are slightly unnatural. **They are a thrall**, completely under Strahd’s control, and here to deliver a message: _“You are making dangerous enemies.”_                                           | **Insight (DC 12)** to notice vacant eyes and stiff movements. **Remove Curse** or a similar spell can break the thrall’s control (if cast quickly).                                                                                                                     |
| **9**  | A **cloaked figure offers information on Strahd’s hidden dealings** but demands payment in the form of **blood**—a mere drop, or something more.                                                                                                                                | If they agree, they take **1d4 necrotic damage** per drop of blood given. **Religion (DC 16)** to recognize this as part of an old vampire pact ritual.                                                                                                                  |
| **10** | A **Zarovich agent accidentally lets slip a reference to the Elder God** Strahd is holding back. When questioned, they **either deny it fiercely or attempt to eliminate the party on the spot**.                                                                               | **Intimidation (DC 15)** to make them reveal more. If combat breaks out, they summon **1d4 + 1 enforcers** within 1d4 rounds.                                                                                                                                            |
| **11** | The party wakes up to find **a black envelope slipped under their door**. Inside is a single playing card: **The King of Spades, marked with blood.** Anyone in the party with connections to the underworld knows this is Strahd’s way of marking people of interest.          | **History (DC 14)** to know this means the party is under direct observation. If ignored, roll **1d6**: (1-3) no consequence yet, (4-6) they are visited soon.                                                                                                           |
| **12** | A **blood-drenched carriage** with no driver stops near the party. Inside is a gift box with a personal note from Strahd, **praising them for their work or warning them of their choices**—depending on their recent actions.                                                  | **Arcana (DC 16)** to sense an enchantment on the carriage. If the party opens the box, roll **1d4**: (1) a rare but cursed artifact, (2) a chilling note predicting their deaths, (3) a vial of unknown blood, (4) something personally meaningful to one party member. |

### 1. **Mysterious Words and Phrases**

Strahd (as Chordant) can speak in riddles or throw out seemingly disconnected comments that, upon reflection, might hint at his knowledge of the cosmic threat. You can plant these moments of unsettling foreshadowing in seemingly casual interactions.

- **"The world is but a fragile thread, is it not? One wrong move, one lost hour... and all could be swallowed."**
    
    - This line could come off as a philosophical musing, but it might be subtly alluding to the Elder God’s imminent threat. Strahd might even ask questions like, _“Do you believe that time is real? Or is it merely a construct to keep us from seeing the abyss?”_
- **"Sometimes the smallest crack in a dam leads to a flood that none can control. I find myself pondering... what if we were the cracks?"**
    
    - This could be Strahd hinting at the cracks in reality that the Elder God represents, and that the party itself could either be the key to sealing it (or unleashing it). It’s an offhand way of implying something catastrophic without directly saying it.
- **"I’ve heard it said that there are places where time and space seem to fold in on themselves... strange, isn’t it?"**
    
    - This could be a direct reference to the chaotic, eldritch nature of the Elder God, but in a way that makes it sound like an old tale or folk rumor. It could catch the party off-guard, leaving them to wonder if Chordant knows something that he’s not saying outright.

---

### 2. **Behavioral Hints**

While Strahd is in disguise, his actions might hint at the immense burden he's carrying. He may act in ways that are both cryptic and strangely distant, almost as though his mind is somewhere else, wrestling with the weight of his responsibility to keep the Elder God imprisoned.

- **Absurdly Long Periods of Silence**: Chordant might pause in conversation for unsettlingly long periods, as though he’s listening to something far off, or contemplating something much larger than the party’s immediate concerns. These moments of silence could suggest that he's not fully "present" in his human guise, as his mind is preoccupied with the task of holding back the cosmic threat.
    
- **Unusual Reactions to the Paranormal**: When dealing with paranormal events or supernatural creatures, Chordant might express knowledge of them that doesn’t fit with his persona. He could make statements that sound prophetic or unnatural, like:
    
    - _“The boundaries between the planes are always thinner at night… but even more so now. I feel it.”_
    - _“There are things far worse than the monsters that lurk in Barovia’s shadows.”_ This could give the party a sense that he's not just a regular citizen, but someone deeply entrenched in the supernatural fabric of the world.
- **Strange Knowledge or Familiarity with Occult Topics**: He might occasionally bring up forbidden topics in a very offhand way, dropping knowledge of ancient rituals or eldritch lore that seems _too_ familiar for a normal person. For example:
    
    - _"I once read an account of a god whose name was whispered through the ages, always feared, yet never spoken aloud. A pity that such things are forgotten..."_
    - _“Some curses cannot be lifted. The best one can do is delay the inevitable. But there are those who are prepared for such things.”_
    - These phrases would leave the party questioning whether Chordant knows more about the Elder God than he lets on. He could mention things like ancient cults, forgotten deities, and cosmic horrors in passing, hinting that he has a personal stake in stopping them—without directly admitting why.

---

### 3. **Hints in His Motivations**

Strahd, in his undercover persona, might subtly guide the party in ways that make them feel like they’re heading toward some larger purpose—one that could either help or hinder his ultimate plan. He could subtly nudge the party into dealing with certain situations, while masking his own intentions.

- **Leading the Party to Certain Locations or Enemies**: Strahd might subtly push the party toward places or enemies that are unknowingly linked to the Elder God’s return. He could say things like:
    
    - _“The Mists will guide you to where you need to be. I wouldn’t go looking for trouble, but sometimes it finds you.”_
    - _“There’s a power in the village of Barovia… you might want to investigate. Some forces have become too strong there. It may be the key to understanding what’s coming.”_ These sorts of statements could seem innocuous at first but later reveal that Strahd is guiding the party toward areas where he’s trying to delay the Elder God’s emergence or where key pieces of the cosmic puzzle lie hidden.
- **Subtle Shifts in Tone or Urgency**: As Chordant, Strahd might also have moments where his tone shifts in unexpected ways, growing more intense and desperate when speaking about certain matters—like the potential destruction of Barovia or the danger of an impending event. These small moments of passion could reveal that, underneath his calm exterior, Strahd is desperately trying to stave off a greater evil that threatens the world:
    
    - _“We all have our roles to play. Even in the darkest hour, we must hold firm. If we fail... we _all_ fail.”_

---

### 4. **Dreams and Visions**

You can also tie Strahd’s influence into the party’s dreams or visions. Perhaps, unbeknownst to them, he’s feeding them dreams or strange premonitions tied to the Elder God’s awakening.

- **Dreams of the Elder God**: Chordant might secretly induce nightmares or dreams in the party that offer glimpses into the terror of the Elder God. These could be surreal, almost ungraspable experiences where they see a massive, incomprehensible presence rising from beneath the earth or beyond the stars—always just out of reach, but with a sense of looming dread. The dreams could even contain cryptic warnings:
    
    - _“The stars will fall, and the cracks will widen. All things are born from darkness, but not all can survive it.”_
    - The dreams could be increasingly tied to places or people that Chordant knows will play a role in the final confrontation with the Elder God.
- **Visions of the Past or Future**: Strahd might also have moments where he unknowingly (or knowingly) reveals his past dealings with the Elder God. The party could stumble across a location that triggers a vision of Strahd’s previous attempts to hold back the horror. These could be brief flashes of events from centuries ago, where Strahd faced off against cultists or horrors trying to breach the barrier. The visions might have the flavor of Strahd trying to protect Barovia from something that threatens far beyond its borders.

---

### 5. **Fearing the Unknowable**

Strahd might occasionally express a deep sense of foreboding when the conversation turns to the supernatural or the unknown. Perhaps, when discussing Barovia's many dark secrets, Chordant can hint that there are things even he doesn't fully understand or control, leading to a growing sense of unease.

- **"There are things that even I dare not confront. The mind cannot comprehend what waits behind the veil of this reality."**
- **"To know the future is to be forever burdened by it. There are some truths we are not meant to learn."**

These comments would seem offhand, but they may suggest that Strahd, despite his immense power, is ultimately out of his depth when it comes to the cosmic horror he's keeping at bay. His secret burden would be slowly revealed through such cryptic remarks.

---

### 6. **Final Reveal**

The final interactions with Strahd, when the party realizes his true identity, can tie everything together. Perhaps, as the cosmic horror threatens to escape, Strahd, in a moment of desperation, admits the truth to the party, explaining his tragic sacrifice. This revelation will make all of his earlier hints come into focus. The party will understand that Strahd, while a villain in many ways, truly believes he's the only one standing between the Elder God and the rest of the world.
