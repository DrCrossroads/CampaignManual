### **Traits**

**Spider Climb.** The Eldritch Thrall can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### **Actions**

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 12 Strength saving throw** or be **grappled (escape DC 12).** While grappled, the Thrall can **only use its Eldritch Drain attack** on the target.

**Eldritch Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled target.  
_Hit:_ 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and the targetâ€™s **maximum HP is reduced** by the same amount until they finish a long rest. The Thrall regains HP equal to the damage dealt.

**Maddening Whispers (Recharge 5-6).** The Thrall mutters **incomprehensible words from the beyond**, forcing creatures within **15 feet** who can hear it to make a **DC 12 Wisdom saving throw**. On a failure, a creature takes **9 (2d8) psychic damage** and is **frightened** until the end of its next turn.
