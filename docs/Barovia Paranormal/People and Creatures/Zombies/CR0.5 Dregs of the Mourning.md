**Undead Fortitude**: If damage reduces the Dregs of the Mourning to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw unless it took radiant damage; on a success, it drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Shambling Horde**: The Dregs of the Mourning moves at a slow pace, but its sluggish movements are sometimes used to swarm and overwhelm its prey. It can move up to 40 feet if it has no target to attack.

**Slam**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 7 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

**Rotting Moan** (Recharge 5–6): The Dregs lets out a deep, mournful moan. All creatures within 30 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

###### **Flavor and Setting Adjustments**

**Decay of the Lost**: These zombies are remnants of the city’s past, long forgotten souls risen from the ground by dark forces. As such, they exude a faint, unsettling scent of decay and mildew. Creatures within 10 feet of the Dregs of the Mourning at the start of their turn must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be overcome with unease, giving them disadvantage on their next attack roll.

**Frenzied Lurch**: The Dregs of the Mourning's movements are erratic and driven by a desperate, animalistic hunger. On its turn, it can move 10 feet as a bonus action toward a creature within 30 feet if it is not engaged in melee.

- **Visuals and Atmosphere**: The Dregs of the Mourning appear as the twisted remnants of city dwellers, their clothes tattered and stained with the grime of the streets and the mysterious fogs that often shroud the city. Their eyes are glazed, and their once-proud faces are now vacant and empty, as if the very essence of life has been leached away, leaving behind only the hollow shell of a person.
- **Decay and Miasma**: These zombies are heavily influenced by the decaying nature of the setting—a city on the brink of collapse, with damp, suffocating fogs and forgotten alleyways where the spirits of the past wander. Their very presence drips with the smell of rot, and their dragging steps are accompanied by the faint echoes of ghostly whispers.
- **Psychological Horror**: The Dregs' **Decay of the Lost** ability represents not only their physical decay but also the psychological weight of the urban decay around them. This will likely cause unease and disrupt the players’ sense of comfort, making even a low-level zombie an unnerving threat.
