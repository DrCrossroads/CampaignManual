Head of [[_The Martikov Family]]. [[The Black Feather Distillery]].

The current patriarch, Davian Martikov, is a wereraven, as are his children and grandchildren. Cantankerous father "Old Crow" of [[Urwin Martikov]]. Often blames Urwin for failings in the bootlegging business as Urwin left to start a hotel/speakeasy. The two have been at odds ever since.

Children
- [[Adrian Martikov]] - Eldest Son
- [[Urwin Martikov]] - Middle
- [[Elvir Martikov]] - Youngest Son
- [[Stefania Martikov]] - Daughter

Davian Martikov, who is an old and suspicious man. Until he trusts the characters, he says nothing about the stolen gems but tells them that evil druids and blights have attacked the winery and forced his family to take refuge in the woods.

If the characters complete [[The Bootlegger's Last Run]], Davian is grateful. Only then does he warm up to them.
