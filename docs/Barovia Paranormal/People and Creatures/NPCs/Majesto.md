Donna [[Fiona Wachter]]'s summoned Imp.

Often eavesdrops on the [[_Eldritch Cultists]] in [[Lower Vallaki]]. 

To reward her most loyal followers, Fiona has her pet imp stand invisibly in the center of a pentagram, then performs a false ritual that calls upon "princes of darkness" to lavish their appreciation upon the cultists.' The imp then sprinkles a few silver coins on the floor, which Lady Wachter allows the cultists to keep.
