Part of [[The Afflicted]] and member of the [[_Cult of the Abbot]]. Found chained in [[St. Markovia Sanitorium]].

She considers herself [[Mishka Belview]]'s older sister.

Has been stitched together with leathery wings.

Marzena Belview is skittish and afraid of everyone and everything except for [[Clovin Belview]], whom she allows to come close enough to  feed her.

Marzena stands 4 feet, 5 inches tall and has a hunched posture. Long, stringy black hair hides much of her face, but clearly visible are the spider mandibles and teeth that replace her human mouth. She has the arms and wings of a bat, as well as a cloven hoof in place of her right foot. She doesn't allow anyone to get close enough to undo her shackles, but if her bonds are magically unlocked or if her chains are somehow broken,
she flies away and never returns.

Marzena has the Flight feature. Her madness is embodied in the following statement: "I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they're watching me all the  time."
