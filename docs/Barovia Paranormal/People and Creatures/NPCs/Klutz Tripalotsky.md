Ancient phantom warrior who died by falling upon his own sword. Lived and died long before the days of [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]].

Found in the basement of [[The Lofts]]. If the sword is pulled from his armor, Sir Klutz appears, thanks whoever pulled his weapon free, and agrees to fight alongside that character for the next seven days.

He knows nothing of Strahd's downfall or the curse afflicting Barovia.
