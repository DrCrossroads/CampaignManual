[[_The Vistani]]. Daughter of [[Luvash]].

First introduced in [[Old Man Entranced]], captured by [[Bluto Krogaraov]].

#### ROLEPLAYING ARABELLE
Characters who act quickly can save Arabelle before she drowns. A character on the shore must succeed on a **DC 15 Strength (Athletics)** check to reach her in time. The DC is 10 for characters who took a rowboat out onto the lake.
Arabelle has alabaster-white skin and raven-black hair. If rescued, she demands to be returned to her family's camp outside on the outskirts of Lower Vallaki. She is certain that her father, Luvash, will give the characters a reward for doing so. A descendant of [[Madame Eva CR 11]], Arabelle is unaware of her connection to the Prophet of the Elder God. She acts more like an adult than a child. Despite her recent misadventure, she believes that a great destiny awaits her.
