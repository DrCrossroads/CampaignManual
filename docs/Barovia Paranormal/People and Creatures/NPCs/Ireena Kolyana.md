Member of [[The Kolyana Family]]. Sister of [[Izmark Kolyana IV]].
(LG female human with 14 hit points). [[Kolyana Manor]].

lreena, a striking young woman with auburn hair, has been bitten twice by [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]. The neighbors are afraid of her and avoid her.

Strahd believes Ireena to be his dead wife. Although Ireena may resemble Tatyana, she does not completely look like her and the party can see this with a picture in [[The Lofts]].

The characters are Ireena's best hope for protection, so she is willing to accompany them under certain conditions. Although she appears mild, she has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself. 

She doesn't remember her early past. She doesn't know how she came to Barovia City or where she came from. Moreover, her encounters with Don [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]] are fuzzy memories, and she doesn't know who he was, thanks to his vampiric charm, but she can recall clearly the blazing hunger in his eyes. She remembers very little of his visits. The only thing that has stayed in her mind is a fragment of a sentence, "The gate to my stars." She tells the characters that wolves and other terrible creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks.

Ismark Kolyana III's heart couldn't stand the constant assault, already weak from the bout of influenza he contracted, and he died three days before. Strangely, since his death, the house has not come under attack. She says that no one from the neighborhood or the family has been brave enough to help Ismark IV take  Ismark Kolyana III to the cemetery for proper burial.

Ireena asks the characters if they would be so kind as to help Ismark deliver her father's body safely to Donavich, the local priest. She refuses to be taken to outside the city while her father lies dead on the mansion floor.


## Ireena Kolyana – The Veiled Vessel

### **The Truth of Her Role:**

Ireena is not a reincarnation in the traditional sense—she is the **living anchor for the Gatekeeper**, a vessel meant to house part of the Elder God's essence. This isn't a coincidence. She was **born during a moment of planar instability**, tied by blood and circumstance to ancient rites woven into the land itself.

The **Elder Being**, trapped beneath Barovia, needs **two cosmic locks** undone:

- **Strahd**, its **Keymaster**—a cursed vampire lord whose will is slowly being eroded.
- **Ireena**, the **Gatekeeper**—whose blood, once turned, will finalize the being’s return.

Strahd doesn’t understand this consciously. Instead, he's haunted by visions, dreams, and whispers that **reshape his memories**, making him believe Ireena is his beloved **Tatyana**. The love is **manufactured by the god**, a psychic parasite feeding on his obsession and guilt, twisting it into ritual.

---

## Strahd’s False Memories:

The elder god **infects Strahd’s mind with false echoes**: shared memories, déjà vu, and dreamlike “proof” that Ireena is Tatyana. The more he feeds on Ireena's presence (or her blood), the deeper his madness grows and the more real these visions become.

---

## Ireena’s Signs of the Gatekeeper:

- **Born under a red eclipse** or during a Voidquake.
- **Marked with an eldritch birthmark** in the shape of a closed eye or spiral (or hidden beneath her skin, only visible to void-sensing magic).
- **Unaging** or subtly immune to void effects. Maybe she hears the Elder God _but is repulsed_ by it rather than seduced.
- Can **unintentionally disrupt void-born monsters**—they act skittish or aggressive around her.

---

## The Ritual:

The Elder Being requires:

- **Strahd to turn her** (she must die and rise _by his hand_).
- Her **willingness or emotional submission**—if she loves him back, the Gate opens more easily.
- This is why it’s been failing for generations: Ireena (in her many forms) _never submits_.

If successful, she becomes the **Bride of the Void**, a cosmic vampire **half-woman, half-stellar horror**, and the **doorway through which the Elder Being will walk**.

---

## Narrative Clues the Players Might Discover:

- Ancient texts about the **Bride of the Abyss** whose blood awakens stars.
- Paintings of Ireena through history—different names, same face, unchanged.
- Void cultists who call her “the She-Who-Opens.”
- Elias Harroway refers to her as a “linchpin character.”
- If she sleeps in a place touched by the void, **she dreams of a sea of eyes and stars** and awakes humming songs she's never heard.

## Possible Arcs for Ireena:

1. **Unwitting Target:** She slowly realizes the truth and must grapple with her destiny, asking the players for protection—or distance.
2. **Rejects the Role:** She chooses to break the cycle and destroy herself or allow her soul to be sealed away.
3. **Becomes a Willing Sacrifice:** In a final battle, she offers herself to the void—but on her own terms, twisting the ritual and weakening the god.
4. **Corruption Arc:** If Strahd turns her, she becomes an **antagonist**—the Void Queen—and a future villain or tragic figure for a later chapter.

## Sample Scene: Strahd’s Revelation

> _Strahd clutches Ireena’s face, his eyes sunken and maddened, the tips of his claws twitching in time with his heartbeat._  
> _“You… you don’t remember, do you? How we danced beneath the stars? The promise? The wound? You died in my arms, Tatyana. And now… the stars scream for you again.”_  
> _Behind his pupils, stars spiral. The void looks back._
