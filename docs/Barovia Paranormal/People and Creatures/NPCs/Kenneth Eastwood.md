**Occupation**: Head of [[Paranormal Detective Agency|The Gargoyle's Dawn Detective Agency]] 
**Age**: Late 50s 
**Voice**: Gravelly, Bronx accent  
**Appearance**: Heavyset, balding with slicked-back gray hair, always in a crumpled suit. Smells like stale cigars and burnt coffee. Always has a half-smoked stogie clamped in his teeth.  
**Personality**: Gruff but warm. A classic “tough on the outside, soft in the middle” type. Deep bags under his eyes from too many late nights digging through city records and haunted typewriters.

### **Character Behavior and Interaction Style**

- **Gravitas Meets Chaos**: Kenneth commands respect but is perpetually half a step from losing it. He shouts more out of passion than anger, and has a habit of pacing and muttering when thinking.
- **True Believer**: He absolutely, completely, **wholeheartedly** believes in the supernatural. Ghosts, demons, cursed typewriters—you name it, he’s seen it. Or at least _read about it in a credible pamphlet_.
- **Supportive but Pressured**: Kenneth **wants the team to succeed**, but he’s also juggling mounting debt, pressure from the church (who want to “sanitize” the truth), and thinly veiled threats from Barovia’s crime families.
- **Loyal to a Fault**: Kenneth will go down with the ship before he lets someone hurt one of his agents. He won’t ask players to take a case he wouldn’t do himself—but he might bend the truth about how dangerous it is.
- **Blackboard Conspiracist**: His office has a corkboard full of yarn-tied clippings. He insists the house collapses, ghost sightings, and power outages are all connected to a secret war for the city’s soul.

### **Role in the Campaign**

- **Narrative Hub**: Kenneth assigns missions, provides updates, clues, or hunches, and occasionally calls the players back in to review weird evidence that just came in.
- **Pressure Valve**: He allows players to unload what they’ve found, and then redirects it with sarcasm, tension-breaking humor, or worried exposition.
- **Ties to Factions**: He owes favors to the wrong people. This lets him be the source of morally gray jobs, warnings, or political insights. He’s also on thin ice with the **City Council**, the **Church of Eternal Light**, and the **Kolyana Family**.

### **Sample Dialogue**

> “Listen, kid, I ain’t sayin’ ya gotta believe me—hell, most nights I barely believe myself—but somethin’s been feedin’ on the dreams of half the Northside, and the city’s pretendin’ it’s just gas leaks. Gas leaks don’t scream your mother’s name while yer tryin’ to sleep, alright?”

> “The mayor? Don’t make me laugh. That guy’s got more strings than a piano and not a single damn note worth hearin’.”

### **Side Quests Involving Kenneth**

#### 1. **“Debt Collector’s Knock”**
Kenneth borrowed money from a crime family to keep the agency open. Now thugs are showing up asking for repayment—in the form of a “favor.” The players can investigate who sent them, or find a way to repay the debt with paranormal means (haunted casino heist?).

#### 2. **“The Missing File”**
Kenneth claims he filed something crucial for an ongoing case years ago—but the city archives say it never existed. The players can track down the file, revealing someone is systematically erasing supernatural evidence from public records.

#### 3. **“Old Flames and Faint Whispers”**
Kenneth’s ex-wife—once a fellow believer—has returned with warnings about something big stirring in the city’s catacombs. She wants Kenneth to shut the agency down. Players must decide who’s telling the truth.

#### 4. **“The Last Case of Marcus Flynn”**
One of Kenneth’s former agents disappeared investigating a case tied to the mayor’s office. Kenneth believes Marcus found something that terrified even him. He asks the players to quietly follow the breadcrumbs.

#### 5. **“Shadows of the Watcher”**
Kenneth finds himself haunted by recurring dreams of a room full of mirrors and voices that aren’t his. He’s convinced it’s a curse laid on him by a “Watcher from Beyond” trying to silence the agency. But it could be early symptoms of something… worse.
