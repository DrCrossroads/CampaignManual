Former leader of [[_The Packhounds]]. Betrayed by Kiril for peace between [[_The Zarovich Family]] and the Packhounds. Currently imprisoned by [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]], in the basement levels of [[The Lofts]].

Not wanting to start an outright war, Strahd locked Emil up after the Zarovich Family last had an encounter with the Packhounds, rather than killing him.

Emil rewards the characters for freeing him by attacking them when a good opportunity arises. Emil doesn't turn against the characters if they claim to be allies of his wife, Zuleika. In that case, he tries to leave the castle and reunite with her, staying with the characters only until an opportunity to leave presents itself.

If the party escorts Emil to [[The Packhounds' Warehouses]], he can command the other werewolves not to attack the characters as they make their way inside.

If Emil Toranescu is present when Kiril returns, Emil is determined to kill his rival and become the pack leader once again.

If both Kiril and Emil die, Zuleika becomes pack leader.
