Member of [[_The Wachter Family]]
Youngest adult son of [[Fiona Wachter]]. Brother of [[Nikolai Wachter Jr.]]

Brash drunkard always looking for trouble, though smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers. Isn't home during the day and never talks about his mother, because he doesn't like attending to his mother or listening to her tiresome prattle.

He'd rather listen to tales of the characters' harrowing adventures or hear about how the characters plan to "free" [[Lower Vallaki]] from [[_The Vallakovich Family]].
