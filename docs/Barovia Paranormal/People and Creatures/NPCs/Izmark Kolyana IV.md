Defacto head of [[The Kolyana Family]] after the death of his father.

Ismark (LG male human veteran) is a young man who sits in [[The Vine]] by himself at a corner table, sipping his wine. Other people call him "Ismark the Lesser" because he has lived in the shadow of his father for most of his life.

Ismark doesn't show the typically dour of most people in Barovia City. He invites the characters to join him, offers to pay for their wine, and asks for their aid in protecting his adopted sister, [[Ireena Kolyana]]. If they agree to help, he takes them to the [[Kolyana Manor]]. He wants the characters
to help him escort Ireena to Krezk, which (he hopes) is beyond the reach of [[_The Zarovich Family]] and the wars between crime families. Ismark
knows that moving Ireena is a gamble, since she's not feeling well when she is outside their home.

Ismark is tight-lipped, unless the talk deals with Ireena or [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]].

Ismark dislikes Strahd and the Zarovich family. He also knows that, for some unknown reason, Strahd is attracted to Ireena and desires her above all others.

Ismark has spent most of his adult life training with weapons. If the characters suggest that he accompany them, Ismark agrees provided that Ireena is first taken to a place of safety. As long as Ismark accompanies the characters, he acts as a party member for the purpose of determining each character's share of experience points (though he gains no experience points himself).
