[[_The Vistani]]
(CE male human bandit captain)

Arrigal and his brother, [[Luvash]] see themselves as  in charge of the Vistani in [[Vistani Park]].

Vistani assassin in [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]'s employ. He will attempt to steal or even kill members of the party.

Arrigal is a much more dangerous creature than his brute of a brother. If the characters have something in their possession that is either useful or harmful to Strahd and Arrigal becomes aware of it, he tries to deprive the characters of this item, stalking them if necessary and going as far as to kill one or more of them if he thinks he can escape with the item in his possession. If he succeeds, he delivers the item to Strahd.

If alive, appears in [[Lady Wachter's Wish]] and [[Arrigal's Hunt]].
