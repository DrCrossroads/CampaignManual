The mortician of the [[Lower Vallaki Morgue]].

Reclusive and disliked.

One night several months ago, Strahd visited Henrik in the guise of an imposing, well-dressed businessman named Vasili von Holtz and promised the coffin maker "good business" in exchange for his help. Since then, Henrik's workshop has become the lair of a pack of [[CR3 The Feral Nightstalker]]s-who were turned by Strahd. These vampires are lying low for the time being. The vampires plan to attack [[St. Andral's Church of the Light]] (see [[St. Andral's Feast]]). When Henrik learned about the sacred bones buried under the church, the vampire spawn ordered him to steal the bones, which Henrik paid Milivoj the gravedigger to do.

Every window of Henrik's morgue is a latticework of iron fitted with squares of frosted glass and locked from the inside. The outside doors of the shop are barred shut from within. If the characters knock on one of them, Henrik shouts, "We're closed! Go away!" without opening the door. If the characters accuse Henrik of stealing the bones of St. Andral, he shouts again, "Go away! Leave me alone!"

If the characters break into the store, Henrik offers no resistance. He tells them where to find the bones (in the upstairs bedroom wardrobe, area N6e) and the vampire nest (in the upstairs wood storage room).

If the characters report the theft of the bones to [[Precinct 7 - The Bonehouse]], cops to arrest Henrik and retrieve the bones.

If the guards show up during daylight hours, Henrik surrenders himself and the bones without a fight, claiming that vampires forced him to steal the bone, he will then be sent to the nearest asylum.

If the guards come at night, Henrik surrenders himself and tells the guards where the bones are hidden, but he won't retrieve the bones himself for fear of being killed by the vampires.
