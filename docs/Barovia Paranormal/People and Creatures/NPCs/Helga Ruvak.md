Vampire spawn of [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]. Will pretend to be a helpless maid to gain the party's trust before attacking them. Found in [[The Lofts]]. Hopes to be Strahd's next gal.

Claims to be the daughter of a bootmaker, kidnapped and forced into service by Strahd. She pleads, on her hands and knees if necessary, to be saved from this awful place.

Helga will join the party if the characters ask her along. She intends to attack the characters but does so only if she senses an opportunity that doesn't involve having to fight the entire party. She also attacks if commanded to do so by Strahd.

Helga plays the part of the innocent damsel in distress to the last, revealing her ferocity only when she attacks.

She is, in fact, the bootmaker's daughter she claims to be, but she chose a life with [[_The Zarovich Family]].
