Theme song: No Time for Caution

Once a common man wanting a taste of adventure, now a god-touched horror, Strahd is no mere vampire—he is something far worse. Twisted by the influence of Kth'Vulgaroth, his mind and body have become an extension of the abyss. His presence warps reality, his blood hungers for knowledge as much as flesh, and his very name is a whisper in the void.

### **Strahd’s Rule and the Forces That Undermine It**

Strahd's reign over Barovia is absolute—but it is not unchallenged. His grip on the land is slowly being eroded by unseen forces: the **Elder God**, its **dream-manipulating agents**, and **rebellious factions** who either seek to usurp him or unwittingly hasten his downfall. Strahd, in his arrogance, believes himself the master of Barovia, but the reality is that he is trapped in a web of manipulation, both as **the warden of the Elder God’s prison** and **its greatest puppet**.

#### **1. The Paranoia of a Dying Tyrant**

Strahd has ruled Barovia for centuries, but **the whispers have grown louder.** He is no longer certain of his own invulnerability. Dreams plague his mind—visions of horrors beyond his comprehension, shadows that move when they should not, and the creeping sense that something else **is pulling the strings**.

- **The Whispering Darkness**: Strahd’s own mind is not immune to the Elder God’s influence. Though he is powerful, his **immortality is tied to the land**, making him susceptible to the nightmares that plague all of Barovia. The Elder God’s voice slithers into his thoughts, **planting paranoia, distorting reality, and pushing him to madness.**
- **The Shifting Reality of Barovia**: Barovia is becoming more unstable. Strahd has always maintained control over the land’s supernatural elements, but **places shift**, **landscapes change overnight**, and **his minions whisper of things they cannot name.** Strahd tries to convince himself that this is his domain bending to his will—but deep down, he knows something else is at work.
- **His Inability to Trust**: Strahd’s paranoia extends to everyone—**his generals, his spies, even the Vistani.** He knows they are useful, but something about their dream-walking ways unsettles him. He is aware that they hold secrets, but every time he interrogates one, they slip away with half-truths and riddles.

#### **2. Strahd’s Fractured Relationships**

Strahd’s relationships with his allies and minions are beginning to fray as his paranoia and frustration grow.

- **The Vistani: Untrustworthy Advisors**  
    Strahd allows the Vistani to move freely through Barovia, believing them to be loyal or, at the very least, useful. In truth, the Vistani **manipulate him as much as he manipulates them**. They seed his mind with dreams, visions, and **carefully curated truths**, nudging him toward actions that weaken his control over the land. Some Vistani pretend to serve Strahd’s interests while working toward the Elder God’s release.
- **Rahadin: The Last Loyal Blade**  
    Strahd’s chamberlain and executioner, Rahadin, is one of the few individuals he still trusts completely. However, even Rahadin has noticed **his master’s instability**. If Strahd continues down this path, will Rahadin remain loyal, or will he seek to “save” Strahd from his madness?
- **The Abbot and the Monstrous Faithful**  
    The **Abbot of St. Markovia’s Abbey** has already succumbed to the Elder God’s whispers. His **twisted experiments** and belief that he can “fix” Strahd may be a direct manipulation of the Elder God’s will. If Strahd realizes this, he may **destroy the Abbey outright—or seek to use its dark experiments for his own ends.**
- **The Barovian Nobility and Bureaucracy**  
    Strahd relies on Barovia’s remaining noble houses, town officials, and law enforcement to keep order. However, **cracks are forming.** Some of them have begun **having dreams**, whispers of another power rising. Others have encountered **agents of the Elder God**, disguised as criminals, scholars, or even members of the clergy. Corruption, rebellion, and madness **spread in the ranks**, but Strahd cannot stamp it out without drawing attention to his **own growing weakness**.

### **Player Interaction with the Dreamwalkers and Other Agents**

The players will be caught in the middle of this grand, slow-burning **war of the mind and soul**, facing decisions that could tip the balance in favor of **Strahd**, the **Elder God**, or even **their own rebellion**.

#### **1. Encounters with the Vistani Dreamwalkers**

The **Vistani Dreamwalkers** are the most active agents of the Elder God, subtly working to **unravel Strahd’s dominion** through dreams, prophecy, and mind-altering magic. The players may interact with them in various ways:

- **Receiving a Cryptic Dream**  
    A Vistani Dreamwalker may plant a **nightmare or vision** in a character’s mind, revealing **glimpses of a possible future, a forgotten past, or a half-truth meant to steer them down a specific path.** These dreams are never entirely clear, leaving the players to question what is real and what is manipulation.
- **A Deal for Forgotten Memories**  
    Dreamwalkers can **steal memories** as part of their magic. A Vistani might offer a **“boon”** to a character in exchange for a memory—perhaps one that holds deep emotional significance. The trade may seem **innocuous at first**, but later, the player might **forget the name of a loved one, a crucial piece of information, or even why they are on this journey at all.**
- **The Night Market of the Lost**  
    Somewhere deep in Barovia, a **hidden Vistani enclave** exists where dream-fragments, stolen memories, and nightmares are **bought and sold like currency**. Here, the players can trade for **secrets**, but every purchase **has a cost.**

#### **2. The Players as Strahd’s Pawns**

Even if the players seek to overthrow Strahd, he may see them as **useful tools** against the creeping madness of the Elder God. He may **order** them to deal with factions that he believes are working against him—perhaps without revealing that they are agents of the Elder God.

- **A Hunt for Cultists**  
    Strahd might task the party with **hunting down a rogue Vistani Dreamwalker** or a cult of the Elder God. At first, this seems straightforward—until the players uncover the deeper truth that Strahd himself **is the key to the Elder God’s release.**
- **The Bargain of the Damned**  
    If Strahd’s paranoia reaches its peak, he may **offer the players a deal**:  
    “**Find the source of the voices. Silence them. Do this, and I will grant you a prize no mortal can refuse.**”  
    The players must then decide: **help the tyrant, or watch Barovia collapse into something far worse?**
---

#### **3. Encounters with Other Agents**

Not all agents of the Elder God are Vistani. Some may be **corrupt nobles, insane scholars, or even broken remnants of the Silver Order**, once dedicated to destroying Strahd but now driven to **serve the thing beneath Barovia.**

- **The Silent Choir**: A group of Barovian **children** who no longer speak. At night, they are heard chanting in unison. What are they summoning?
    
- **The Hollowed Priests**: Clergy who have **lost their faith** and now preach the doctrine of the Elder God, drawing converts from those who have given up hope.
    
- **The Living Shadows**: Strahd’s spies may **turn against him**, their bodies consumed by darkness, becoming **whispering wraiths that steal dreams and memories from the living.**

### **Eldritch Vampire Traits**

- **Voidborn Regeneration.** Strahd regains **25 hit points** at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point. If he is in dim light or darkness, he regains **35 hit points** instead. He does not regenerate if exposed to direct sunlight or radiant damage.
- **Eldritch Blood Curse.** When Strahd reduces a creature to **0 HP**, their soul is not simply lost—it is _devoured_. They cannot be resurrected unless by **wish** or divine intervention.
- **Warped Reality.** Strahd distorts space around him. Within a **30-foot radius**, non-magical ranged attacks suffer disadvantage, and teleportation magic falters, requiring a **DC 18 Intelligence check** to succeed.
- **Elder Gift: The Hunger Beyond.** Strahd’s bite does more than drain blood—it siphons knowledge. When he successfully bites a creature, he can instantly learn one of their **proficiencies, spells, or secrets**, as determined by the DM.
- **Sanguine Thrall (1/Day)**. When Strahd reduces a creature to 0 HP with **Eldritch Fang**, he can choose to instead leave them at 1 HP, **charmed** by him for 1 hour, as if under the effects of _Dominate Person_. The target remembers none of this afterward.

---

### **Actions**

#### **Multiattack.**
Strahd makes three attacks: one with his **Eldritch Fang**, and two with either **Bloodletter Saber** or **Whispering Revolver**.

##### **Bloodletter Saber** (replaces _Voidclaw_)
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
- **Hit:** 21 (4d6 + 6) slashing damage plus **10 (3d6) necrotic damage**.
- On a hit, the blade drinks the victim’s blood. Strahd regains **10 hit points** if the target is **below half HP**.
> _Flavor:_ This antique cavalry saber hums with a faint whisper, and the metal is blackened with veins of crimson. When it strikes, blood rises unnaturally toward it.

##### **Whispering Revolver** (alt. for the saber, or swap between them depending on range)
_Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, range 60/150 ft., one target.
- **Hit:** 18 (3d10 + 2) force damage plus **7 (2d6) psychic damage**.
- If this attack **reduces a creature to 0 HP**, a **shadow of the target** rises under Strahd’s control (use Shadow stat block, CR 1/2). It lasts until destroyed or 1 hour has passed.
> _Flavor:_ The revolver is carved with sigils. The bullet’s scream lingers in the air. When it kills, the victim's soul flickers visibly.

##### **Eldritch Fang** (replaces _Eldritch Bite_)
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
- **Hit:** 30 (5d8 + 6) piercing damage plus **10 (3d6) necrotic damage**.  
- If the target is **grappled, restrained, or charmed**, they must make a **DC 19 Wisdom saving throw** or suffer **1 level of exhaustion** as their essence is siphoned directly into Strahd’s bloodline.
> _Flavor:_ When Strahd drinks, he doesn’t pierce the neck—his jaw unhinges slightly and his eyes blacken, drinking **not just blood, but memory and soul.**

#### **Call of the Forgotten (Recharge 5-6)**
Strahd extends his will beyond the veil, summoning creatures from the inky void of his patron’s realm. He can summon **one of the following options** within 60 feet of him:
- **Two Abyssal Stalkers** (CR 4) – **Shadowy, tentacled horrors that cling to the players' shadows and feed on their sanity.**
- **Four Eldritch Thralls** (CR 2) – **Twisted humanoid forms with hollow eyes and shifting, ink-like skin. They lash out with elongated, spectral limbs.**
- **A Ghostly Behemoth** (CR 6) – **A mass of floating, grasping arms and wailing faces, a fusion of lost souls bound to Strahd’s will.**

These creatures obey Strahd’s commands for 1 minute, after which they dissolve into wisps of shadow and vanish. If Strahd is in his lair, he can summon an **additional creature** of his choice from this list.

#### **Call of the Abyss (Recharge 5-6).**
Strahd calls on the will of Kth'Vulgaroth, causing shadowy tendrils to erupt in a **30-foot radius** around him. Each creature in the area must make a **DC 19 Dexterity saving throw**, taking **42 (12d6) necrotic damage** on a failure or half on a success. Creatures that fail are also **restrained** by writhing shadows until the end of their next turn.

---

### **Legendary Actions** _(3 per round)_

**Strahd can take three legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn.**

- **Move Without Motion.** Strahd teleports up to **40 feet** within line of sight.
- **Whisper of the Void.** Strahd targets a creature within **60 feet**. They must make a **DC 19 Wisdom saving throw** or suffer **3d10 psychic damage** and be **charmed** for 1 minute. A charmed target perceives Strahd as an **eternal and rightful ruler**.
- **Abyssal Strike (Costs 2 Actions).** Strahd makes a **Voidclaw** attack.
- **Reality Unraveled (Costs 3 Actions).** Strahd distorts reality itself. Until the end of his next turn, attacks against him have **disadvantage**, and creatures within **30 feet** experience vertigo, treating all terrain as difficult.

---

### **Lair Actions** _(Roll 1d4 at Initiative 20; Strahd can’t use the same action twice in a row.)_

1. **Shadows of the Forgotten.** Strahd summons **1d4 shadowy wraiths** (use **Specter** stats) that vanish after 3 rounds.
2. **Blood Eclipse.** The area is bathed in unnatural crimson light. Until the next initiative count 20, Strahd regains **double his regeneration**, and healing spells suffer **disadvantage**.
3. **Endless Descent.** Gravity distorts, causing all creatures to make a **DC 19 Strength saving throw** or be **pulled toward Strahd 15 feet** and knocked prone.
4. **The Blood Moon Calls.** If Strahd has taken damage since his last turn, he immediately regains **40 HP** and may make a single **Voidclaw** attack as a free action.

### **Combat Mechanics & Strategy**

**Phase 1 (Standard Fight)**
> _A tall man in a crisp pinstripe suit steps from the shadows, the brim of his black fedora casting his pale face in dramatic silhouette. A blood-red tie cuts down his chest like a knife, and his sharp features seem sculpted from moonlight and marble. He smiles with quiet confidence, his dark eyes gleaming with a predator’s patience._  
> _He does not rush. He **commands** the room. Every word drips with charm, but you can feel something ancient coiled beneath the silk of his voice. He is Strahd—vampire, mob lord, and undisputed ruler of this cursed dominion._

- Strahd engages in melee combat, using **Eldritch Fang** and **Bloodletter Saber** and **Whispering Revolver** to weaken players.
- At a distance: Strahd uses the **Whispering Revolver**—elegant, efficient, and terrifying.
- Up close: He shifts to the **Bloodletter Saber**, fencing with grace and supernatural precision.
- When weakened or to finish someone: He uses **Eldritch Fang**, consuming more than blood and gaining power from it.
- He charms weaker-willed party members with **Whisper of the Void** to turn them against their allies.
- Lair actions begin influencing the battlefield, shifting reality in subtle, disorienting ways.

**Phase 2 (Reality Warping)**
> _Strahd’s grin falters for the first time as blood stains his lapel. His eyes flicker—first with rage, then something **deeper and older**. His body **shudders**, and then **shadows pour from his back**, unfurling into **coiling, semi-formed limbs** that stretch and twitch unnaturally._  
> _His suit burns away in pieces, revealing skin that gleams like oil and glass. Reality around him **bends**, **flickers**, and **fractures**—you feel your mind strain just looking at him._  
> _His voice returns, but it’s layered—Strahd speaks now with a chorus behind him, some echo that was always there, **watching through him.**_
- At **50% HP**, Strahd _shifts_ into an **eldritch hybrid form**, growing **multiple shadowy limbs** and _phasing in and out of existence_.
- His **Warped Reality** expands to a **60-foot radius**, and now causes **wisdom saving throws** to avoid _short-term madness effects_.
- Strahd now uses **Reality Unraveled** frequently, making positioning a challenge.
- His attacks now **ignore resistance to psychic and necrotic damage.**

**Phase 3 (The Nightmare Unleashed)**
>_Strahd **screams**, but it is not pain—it is **release**. His body breaks apart, not into gore, but into **shards of void**. What reforms is a **thing shaped like a man**, six limbs ending in jagged claws that **swim through space** rather than move through it. His chest is a hollow chasm, stars flickering deep inside it like some **forgotten corner of the cosmos.**_  
>_The floor beneath him **splits open**, devoured by nothingness. His voice is no longer his—it is a **celestial absence**, a **hunger that speaks**, and it demands **submission, or madness.**_
- At **20% HP**, Strahd begins to **merge with the abyss**, transforming into a **nightmare entity with six void-claws and a hollow, cosmic form**.
- **Blood Eclipse becomes permanent,** healing him every round while weakening player healing.
- The battlefield becomes a _voidscape_, with terrain shifting unpredictably.
- A **random PC's shadow detaches each round**, attacking them as a **Shadow Spawn** (CR 7).
- **Strahd's movement becomes impossible to predict, as he can teleport every turn.**
- The final blow against Strahd causes a **massive psychic shockwave**, forcing all creatures to make a **DC 20 Intelligence save** or take **6d10 psychic damage** as Strahd's essence is unmade.
