Member of [[_The Martikov Family]]. [[Danika Dorakova]]'s husband. Co-owner of [[The Blue Water Hotel]]. Father of [[Bray Martikov]] and [[Brom Martikov]].

Usually busies himself in the kitchen.

There's bad blood between Urwin and his father, [[Davian Martikov]], (whom Urwin and Danika refer to as "the old crow").

Urwin Martikov (LG male human) is a wereraven and is a high ranking member of the Martikov family, a crime family full of wereravens. Urwin's wife and business partner, Danika Dorakova (LG female human), is also a wereraven, as are their two sons, Brom and Bray. The boys have only 7 hit points each and, at ages eleven and nine, are too young to be effective combatants.
At any given time, another 1d4 wereravens (members of the family Martikov) are present at the inn and speakeasy, either perched on the rooftop in raven form or huddled inside in human form. These wereravens are loyal to the Martikovs and help protect the inn.
If the characters earn the trust of the wereravens in Vallaki, the Martikov family will watch their backs. The next time the characters get themselves in serious trouble, you can have a group of 1d4 wereravens show up to rescue or otherwise help them.
