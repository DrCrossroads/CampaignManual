Son of [[Donavich]]. 

Doru and a few of his friends wanted to join [[_The Zarovich Family]]. They went to [[The Lofts]] and were missing for a few days. Doru returned as a [[CR3 The Feral Nightstalker]].

Doru hasn't fed since he was imprisoned, and he cries out to his father at all hours. Meanwhile, Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how to save Doru without destroying him. If the characters seem intent on slaying Doru, Donavich does his best to stop them. If Doru dies, Donavich falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair.

Found in the basement of [[The Ivory Dawn]].

If the characters restrain Doru and either promise him blood or threaten to destroy him, or if they kill him and then raise him from the dead, he recounts the events that led to his downfall.
