Head of [[_The Vallakovich Family]]. Husband of [[Lydia Vallakovich]]. Father of [[Victor Vallakovich]].

Vallakovich (NE male human noble), is a ruthless heel who prides himself on his good breeding and finely honed leadership skills.

The don has a brittle ego and is paranoid, and he lashes out at anyone who tries to undermine his authority or treats him disrespectfully. He has two pet mastiffs that follow him everywhere, as well as a murderous and deformed loyal cop named [[Izek Stranzi]].

The don believes that everyone else is beneath him, and those who question his word or challenge his authority must be humbled. He won't pick a fight with well-armed strangers, however. If he can't make the characters yield to his authority, he swallows his pride until he can circle around with Izek Stranzi and assemble his mobsters to run them out of the district.

If the characters get on his bad side, the don accuses them of being "spies of the devil Strahd" and sends twelve mobsters to "teach them a lesson", seize their weapons, and run them out of the district. If the mobsters fail in their duty, the don sends Izek to rally a mob of thirty commoners to lynch the party. If the commoners also fail, the baron summons twelve cops who are loyal to him to defend his mansion, giving characters the run of the district.

If the characters get on his good side, he insists that they join him in the for dinner as special guests.

Two members of the don's household staff have vanished in the past week: the butler and the dona's lady-in-waiting. The don has charged Izek with finding out what happened to them, but investigation isn't Izek's forte. Searches have been organized, to no avail.
