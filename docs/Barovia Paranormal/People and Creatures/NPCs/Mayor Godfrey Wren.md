### The Mayor (Puppet-In-Chief)

**Name**: Mayor Godfrey Wren  
**Public Persona**: Jovial, performative patriot, frequent speaker at public events and charity galas.  
**Private Reality**: Cowardly, scheming, deep in debt to multiple factions. Constantly trying to play all sides to stay alive and in power.

**Allegiances**:
- **The Church**: He's on their payroll. Publicly supports their divine "anti-occult" purges.
- **Strahd**: Secretly receives blood magic-infused tokens from the Count to extend his influence (and perhaps unnaturally his life).
- **Crime Families**: Takes bribes from multiple gangs, grants city contracts, and offers leniency in court.


## MAYORAL INTERACTION STYLES

- **Cowardly Backroom Dealer**: He meets players in private, always sweating, always making excuses. Constantly promises, “My hands are tied, but _you_ could help me...”
- **Charismatic Public Performer**: In public, he gives bold speeches and shakes hands. If the party confronts him in public, he _gaslights and deflects_.
- **Blackmailed Pawn**: Sometimes the players may catch a rare moment of honesty — he’s terrified of Strahd, but _even more terrified_ of what happens if he stops obeying.
