Cruel current leader of [[_The Packhounds]]. Recently took leadership by allying with [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]] and betraying [[Emil Toranescu]].

Ruthless but cunning, Kiril runs the Packhounds with a mix of **brutality and calculated control**. Unlike most werewolves, he wears **silver rings in his ears and fingers**, a display of dominance over the one thing that can kill him.

If the party attacks in members of the Packhounds in the [[The Packhounds' Warehouses]] and leaves Kiril alive, Kiril assembles a hunting party and pursues the party, ambushing them as long as they stay in Krezk Valley or neighboring districts.
