Member of [[_The Packhounds]]. Found in [[The Packhounds' Warehouses]]

10-year-old boy recently welcomed into the pack.

Kellen is a noncombatant with AC 10, 2 hit points, and a werewolf 's damage immunities. He hugs a wooden doll that eerily resembles one of the characters. A tiny slogan etched into the zombie doll reads, "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!"

He was afflicted with werewolf lycanthropy after winning one of [[Kiril Stoyanovich]]'s despicable contests to join the pack.

Was given to [[Wencensia]] to train.

Casting a greater restoration spell or a remove curse spell on Kellen ends his lycanthropy.
