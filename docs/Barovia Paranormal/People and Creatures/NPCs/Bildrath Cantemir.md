Proprietor of [[Bildrath's]], (LN male human commoner)

Bildrath trades with [[_The Vistani]] when they pass through. He is also happy to make a profit from any strangers unlucky enough to find themselves here. He serves his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains since, as he says, "If you want it badly enough, you'll pay for it." Although there are a few other stores, he doesn't see much competition in the district.

If the characters give Bildrath a hard time, he calls [[Parriwimple]].

(LG male human), Bildrath's nephew and stockboy, to help him out. Parriwimple has the statistics of a gladiator, except that he has an Intelligence of 6 and doesn't carry a shield (AC 14). Parriwimple's real name is Parpol Cantemir, but no one in the district calls him that. His muscles rippling beneath his leather tunic should give ample notice of his strength. At the same time, Parriwimple is simple-minded. He is devoted to his uncle and will not follow the characters as long as Bildrath has something to say about it.
