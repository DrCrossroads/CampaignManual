[[_The Vistani]]

Luvash and his brother [[Arrigal]] see themselves as in charge of the Vistani in [[Vistani Park]].

Vistani in [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]'s employ. He will attempt to steal or even kill members of the party.

Father of [[Arabelle]] who can be found in [[Old Man Entranced]]. Arabelle has recently disappeared from the camp and Luvash has sent half of the Vistani in the camp out to search for her.

Luvash is a drunkard.

Luvash is unhappy because his seven-year-old daughter, Arabelle, has vanished. She's been gone for a little more than a day. Because everyone in the camp was drunk and Arrigal was away, no one remembers seeing or hearing anything strange. Luvash is determined to find her, no matter what the cost, and most of his camp is out scouring the woods when the characters arrive.

Luvash won't meddle in the characters' affairs without Strahd's consent, and he is quite content to let the vampire deal with them.

If the characters rescue Arabelle from Rose River and see her safely returned to camp, Luvash is overjoyed and offers to repay the favor.

If the characters ask something of the Vistani but have not earned Luvash's goodwill, he agrees to do business with them if they accomplish one of two tasks: either find his missing daughter or procure six barrels of bootlegged wine and bring them to the camp. Luvash will suggest raiding [[_The Martikov Family]]'s business for the booze.

Luvash's wagon is a mess inside. Empty wineskins, dirty clothes, and mangy furs are strewn about. A small hammock strung across the width of the wagon under the driver's seat serves as Arabelle's bed. A burlap doll with button eyes lies in the hammock; Arabelle has no other possessions.

A small iron stove in the middle of the wagon keeps the interior warm.
