Head of [[_The Wachter Family]]. Wants to seize control of [[Lower Vallaki]] underground from [[_The Vallakovich Family]]. Wishes for favor from [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]] and [[_The Zarovich Family]].

Mother of [[Nikolai Wachter Jr.]], [[Karl Wachter]], and --

[[_Eldritch Cultists]] in Lower Vallaki consider Fiona to be their spiritual leader.

Holds influential sway over the Lower Vallaki underground.

Hates Don Vargas Vallakovich and is often quoted saying "I'd rather serve the devil than see the Vallokovich family rise to more power."

Fiona makes no secret of her family's long-standing loyalty to Don von Zarovich.

If the characters come to Fiona for assistance in overthrowing Don Vallakovich, she'll be all ears and start by suggesting they kill Izek Strazni.

If they come looking for a way to defeat Strahd, Fiona will turn them away, stating that she is, nor ever will be, Strahd's enemy.

Lady Wachter has a different list of prepared spells from that of the priest in the Monster Manual:
	Cantrips (at will): light, mending, thaumaturgy
	1st level (4 slots): command, purify food and drink, sanctuary
	2nd level (3 slots): augury, gentle repose, hold person
	3rd level (2 slots): animate dead, create food and water

Has an event: [[Lady Wachter's Wish]].

### Secrets

Fiona conspired to wed her young daughter, Stella Wachter, to the Don Vargas's son, Victor Vallakovich, as part of a plot to gain a foothold in the Don's Family, but Stella found Victor to be demented, and he showed no interest in Stella whatsoever.
In fact, he spoke such unkind words to Stella that she went mad, and Fiona had to lock her daughter away.

Fiona has created relationships with the cultists in Lower Vallaki and plans to take the underground by force once she has amassed enough cultists who follow her. To reward her most loyal followers, she has her pet imp, [[Majesto]], stand invisibly in the center of a pentagram, then performs a false ritual that calls upon "princes of darkness" to lavish their appreciation upon the cultists.' The imp then sprinkles a few silver coins on the floor, which Lady Wachter allows the cultists to keep.

Another secret of Fiona's is that she sleeps with the corpse of her dead husband, [[Nikolai Wachter Sr.]], who died of sickness nearly three years ago and whom Fiona cherished. Lady Wachter casts gentle repose spells on the corpse to keep it from deteriorating.
