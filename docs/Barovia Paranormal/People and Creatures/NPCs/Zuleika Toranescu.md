Member of [[_The Packhounds]]. Vengeful mate of [[Emil Toranescu]].

She will help the party in exchange for Emil's freedom or for Kiril's death
Believing her mate to be dead by Strahd's hand, she prays to Mother Night for guidance, hoping that the goddess might hold enough sway over Strahd to persuade him to free her beloved.

Zuleika sees the characters as the answer to her prayers and asks them to kill Kiril when he returns from his latest job.

Kiril won't let Zuleika do much, confining her to the warehouses.

If both Kiril and Emil die, Zuleika becomes pack leader
