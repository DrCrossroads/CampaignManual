Drunk. Found in [[Lower Vallaki]].

He sets out each morning on the Rose River to go fishing and returns every evening, but hasn't caught any fish in a while.

Can be interacted with during [[Old Man Entranced]]. He has [[Arabelle]] in a burlap sack in his boat. Often visits [[The Rusted Nail]].

Bluto Krogarov is a destitute drunkard. He's desperate to catch some fish and trade them for wine at [[The Blue Water Hotel]]. After he was unable to catch a single fish for a week, he kidnapped Arabelle, believing that [[_The Vistani]] are lucky. He intends to sacrifice her to the river, hoping it will give up some of its fish in return.

If the characters watch Bluto from the shore for several minutes, or if they row out into the lake to greet him, he tosses the burlap sack into the water, watches it sink, and waits with fishing pole in hand for his reward Bluto is a hollow shell of a man, barely able to understand his own actions. He is unarmed and does nothing to aid or thwart the characters.
