Member of [[_The Vallakovich Family]]. Son of Vargas Vallakovich and [[Lydia Vallakovich]].

Once a possible suitor to [[Stella Wachter]].

Skittish and miserable, he has confined himself to the attic of the Vallakovich manor, where he is content to avoid the unwanted attention of his mother and the disapproving glares of his father. Years ago, Victor found an old spellbook in the mansion's library and used it to teach himself magic. He has been busy constructing a teleportation circle in the hope of escaping Barovia City and leaving his parents to their doom.
