Head of the [[_Cult of the Abbot]]. Found in [[St. Markovia Sanitorium]].

**A former doctor turned eldritch surgeon**, still convinced his work is **holy**.

- **A once-revered surgeon and theologian**, now utterly consumed by his "divine" mission.
- **His goal:** To **perfect the human form** through **surgery and alchemy**, purging "impurities" and **"elevating" the broken.**
- **He still believes himself righteous**, convinced that he is bringing people closer to "the light."
- He doesn't care where his subjects come from, only that the study is complete.

What the Abbot knows:
- The Abbot knows that Strahd is immortal. In the Abbot's own words, Strahd sold his soul to a dark god and now is a permanent fixture in Barovia. The Abbot doesn't know that this dark god is an elder god and doesn't quite understand the nature of the Dark Powers. He only knows that they exist, waiting to corrupt the souls of innocent people.
- If asked for more details about these dark gods and their connection to Strahd, the Abbot openly admits his lack of knowledge. However, he does mention reading about an old temple (The Amber Temple) sunk deep under the sea that holds a vast library. Though the Abbott doesn't know how to get there.
- The Abbot has accepted Strahd's permanence in Barovia. He doesn't believe that Strahd will ever be killed or otherwise displaced and that trying to do so is a fool's errand. He finds Strahd's existence fascinating and is working on creating a being that can do the same.

Roleplaying the Abbot:
- The Abbot views everyone as less than him, though he doesn't treat people poorly when he speaks to them, he finds people fascinating as if studying them. He views people as if he knows he can crush them easily and mold them into something he views as beautiful.
- *Everyone is an animal, and animals are just machines. I can rebuild them as I see fit.*

### **Traits**

**Unholy Sanctity.** The Abbot’s divine presence is warped. When a creature starts its turn within **10 feet** of him, it must make a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or become **Charmed** for 1 minute, believing the Abbot to be a holy savior. If attacked, the effect ends.

**Surgeon's Precision.** The Abbot’s melee attacks **ignore resistances to non-magical attacks**, as his blade cuts on a level beyond physical flesh.

**The Work Must Continue.** If the Abbot is reduced to **0 HP**, his body **rapidly regenerates**, and he returns to life at full HP **in 1d4 hours**, unless his body is destroyed by **fire or radiant damage**.

---

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** The Abbot makes two attacks with **Scalpel of the Divine Flesh** or uses **Revelation of the Flesh**.

**Scalpel of the Divine Flesh.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

- **Hit:** 2d8 + 3 slashing damage, plus **2d6 psychic damage**.

**Revelation of the Flesh (Recharge 5-6).** The Abbot **reveals the truth behind his form**, momentarily warping into an **impossible shape**. All creatures within **20 feet** must make a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or take **4d6 psychic damage** and become **stunned for 1 round**. On a success, they take half damage and are not stunned.

**Lay on Hands (1/Day).** The Abbot touches a creature, restoring **50 HP**, or removing a disease or poison.

---

### **Bonus Actions**

**Surgical Strike.** If the Abbot **deals damage to a creature**, he can force them to make a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or be **paralyzed for 1 round**, as his blade severs vital nerves.

**Whispers of the Elder God.** The Abbot mutters an unnatural phrase. One creature within **30 feet** must make a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or suffer **disadvantage on all attacks and ability checks for 1 minute**.
