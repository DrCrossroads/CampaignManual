Member of [[_The Zarovich Family]]. Vampire companion to [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]. Found in the apartment area or one of the speakeasies of [[The Lofts]].

A dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in the past. Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and has retreated to either his room or a speakeasy until Strahd's mood improves.

If attacked, he hurls himself out a window and lands like a cat on a lower balcony. He will lead pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the head of the family happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).

In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of melancholy. Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the catacombs with Strahd's other castoff consorts.

The leaded windows in his room are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn't allow for much of a view. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there's a 50 percent chance that a [[CR3 The Feral Nightstalker]] crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.

TREASURE
On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a platinum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns (worth 15 gp). Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pendant (worth 65 gp).
