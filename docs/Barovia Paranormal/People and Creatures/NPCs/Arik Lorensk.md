Bartender at [[The Vine]] in [[Barovian Heights]].

A pudgy little man named Arik Lorensk (CN male human commoner) tends bar.
Mindlessly, he cleans glasses, one after another.  When they're all clean, he starts over. If he is spoken to, he takes orders for drinks in a dull, hollow voice. After serving drinks, Arik returns to cleaning glasses. He ignores all attempts to question him.

Sells Mid-Range Spirits for x5 the price.
