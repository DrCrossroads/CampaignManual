Zygfrek stands 4 feet, 7 inches tall. The left side of her face and body is covered with Uzard scales, the right with tufts of gray wolf fur. Between these tufts is pale human skin. One of her eyes is that of a feline, and her fingers and hands resemble cat's paws with opposable thumbs. She has a gruff voice and wears a gray cloak with black fur trim.

Zygfrek has the Darkvision feature. Her madness is embodied in the following statement: "I don't like the way people judge me all the time."
