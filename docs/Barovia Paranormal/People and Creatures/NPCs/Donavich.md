Father of [[Doru]]. Can be found in the church praying for the salvation of his son. Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how to save Doru without destroying him.

- Ireena Kolyana isn't the natural daughter of Kolyan Indirovich. Although Ireena never knew, Kolyan found her at the edge of the Svalich Woods. She was but a girl then and seemed to have no memory of her past. Kolyan adopted her and loved her dearly. 
- Every night at midnight, the spirits of dead adventurers rise up out of the [[The Cliffside Graveyard]], forming a silent procession as they walk the road toward The Lofts. (See [[March of the Dead]])
