Member of [[_The Zarovich Family]]. Accountant to [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]. Found in [[The Lofts]], chained to a heavy wooden desk.

Has no interest in the characters or their concerns. Under no circumstances does he voluntarily leave the room.

Lief pulls a rope near him the instant he feels threatened.
Pulling the rope requires an action. When the rope is pulled, a tremendously loud gong sounds. One or mor creatures arrive ld6 rounds later, attacking any characters still in the room. Determine the creatures randomly by rolling a d4:

| d4  | Creature                      |
| --- | ----------------------------- |
| 1   | 1d6 shadows                   |
| 2   | 1d4 vampire spawn             |
| 3   | 1d4 wights                    |
| 4   | 1 wraith and 1d4 + 1 specters |
Lief was pressed into service by Strahd many years ago. He keeps all the books for Strahd, recording the vampire's riches and conquests. Lief has been in the Lofts longer than he can remember. He is grumpy because Strahd doesn't allow him to know about all his treasures.

Even so, Lief has found out where one of Strahd's secret treasures lies. If he is treated with kindness, Lief will divulge the hiding place of the [[Magic Items to defeat Strahd#**The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (The Black Star Pendant)**|The Black Star Pendant]], as indicated by your [[Tarokka Cards and Reading|tarroka reading]]. Lief can draw a crude map showing a route to that location. His map is geographically accurate, but he admits that it doesn't acknowledge or avoid any dangers that might lie along the way. Lief doesn't necessarily know the most direct path to the symbol's location.
