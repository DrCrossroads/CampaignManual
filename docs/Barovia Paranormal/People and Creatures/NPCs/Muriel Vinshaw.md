Member of [[_The Martikov Family]].

She uses a lantern to signal the party if they arrive in Berez at night.

[[CR3 Wereraven]] scout in human form who stays in [[Berez]] to watch over [[Baba Lysaga CR 11]]. She warns the party of the danger of facing Baba Lysaga head on with the following information:

- Berez was abandoned long ago after [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]] and his enforceres burned down the village.
- An ancient and powerful hag named Baba Lysaga lives in a nearby temple in the Shadow Forest. When not in her temple, Baba Lysaga can be seen picking through the debris of Berez.
- Baba Lysaga is suspected of sabotaging the Martikov's bootlegging operation and is a long enemy to the wereraven family.

Muriel avoids combat and flees if attacked. She conceals her lycanthropic nature for as long as possible, and she doesn't willingly identify other wereravens with whom she's acquainted. She can't be persuaded to accompany the characters if they decide to confront Baba Lysaga. However, Muriel knows Barovia City well enough to point out other nearby locations that might interest the adventurers, including [[Argynvost Citadel]], and the ancient burial ground known as [[Yesterhill Point]]. Muriel grew up hearing stories about the druids of Yesterhill Point, specifically how they turned away from their ancient beliefs to worship an ancient being. Muriel knows that the druids visit the circle of standing stones from time to time, and she does her best to avoid them.
