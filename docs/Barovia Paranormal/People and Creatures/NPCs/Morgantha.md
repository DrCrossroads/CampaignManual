Head of [[_The Coven]].

Mother of [[Bella Sunbane]] and [[Offalia Wormwiggle]].

Morgantha, a night hag in the guise of an old woman, has come to [[Barovian Heights]] from [[The Old Bonegrinder Mill]] to sell her [[Dream Pastries]] for 1 cp apiece. She goes from house to house, knocking on doors. Most of the time, no one answers. When someone does, Morgantha tries to peddle her wares, offering customers an escape from the misery and despair of everyday Barovian life.

Kidnaps children to grind their bones into powder for baking dream pastries.

Gave [[Cyrus Belview]] the coven's hag eye so she could spy on [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]].

Morgantha tolerates her daughters only because they help her complete the coven. If one of them dies, Morgantha sets out to abduct and consume a human child so that she can give birth to a new daughter.
