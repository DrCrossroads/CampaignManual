Former commander of [[_The Silver Order]].

Vladimir Horngaard joined the Silver Order at a young age and quickly earned the friendship of its founder, the silver dragon [[Argynvost]]. When he became a knight of the order, he traveled to distant lands to wage war against the forces of evil. The dragon stayed home and, in the guise of a human noble named Lord Argynvost, brought new initiates into the order. 

**Enemies of Strahd**. Vladimir found himself fighting [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]'s armies time and again as the Order tried to fight back against the rising Eldritch forces, although they didn't realize the full extent of the eldritch influences. When it became clear that Strahd couldn't be stopped, the knights of the order led hundreds of refugees to Argynvost Citadel, but Strahd tracked them to their sanctuary and overwhelmed them with a vast force. Vladimir, whom Argynvost had made a field commander, couldn't hold back the evil tide and was killed, only after the heartbreak of witnessing Strahd himself slay Vladimir's beloved, his fellow knight [[Godfrey Gwilym]]. With the battle won, Strahd surrounded Argynvostholt. Rather than cower in his lair, Argynvost emerged and battled Strahd's armies to the bitter end.

**Deadly Vengeance**. Unwilling to accept his failure, Vladimir returned as a revenant. So great was his hatred of Strahd and his thirst for vengeance that those feelings fueled the spirits of many of his fellow knights including Godfrey-to come back as revenants as well. Vladimir continued to wage the hopeless war, even as Strahd tightened his grip on the valley.

**Blinded by Hatred**. Vladimir hates Strahd but doesn't want to see the vampire given his final rest. Vladimir wants Strahd to suffer forever for the deaths of Godfrey and Argynvost, the destruction of their order, and all the other crimes of which the vampire is guilty. Vladimir believes that all of Barovia has been swept into hell, and he wants to make sure that Strahd stays trapped in it forever. It angers Vladimir that he and his fellow knights are also trapped, but in Vladimir's mind, such is the price of keeping the vampire confined. Even his love for Godfrey is now just a dim memory shrouded by his hate.
Were Vladimir to let go of his hatred, his spirit would find peace and could remember the warmth of love. Gone are the days of honor and valor.
