Naive young girl from the [[Barovian Heights]]. Ran away from home to join [[_The Zarovich Family]] and be with [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]. Can be found in [[The Lofts]].

Daughter of [[Mad Mary]].

Owns a strange doll made by [[Gadof Blinsky]]. Stitched into the hem of its dress is a frayed tag bearing the words "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!"

The doll is old and its eyes seem to follow anyone near it. If a character fails a sanity check while holding it, they hear incoherent whispers.

Gertruda is oblivious to any danger to herself-especially from Strahd, who has charmed her. Sheltered by her mother, she was never allowed to leave home as a child. She finally slipped away and made her way to the castle, drawn by its majesty.

Gertruda is innocent, and years spent as a shut-in have twisted her sense of reality. Consequently, she maintains a fairy-tale view of life. When faced with a decision, she almost always makes the most simplistic choice. She is naive to the point of being a danger to herself and others. Fortunately for her, Strahd has not yet bitten her, though he intends to. (If he can do so while the characters look on helplessly, so much the better.)
