[[_The Vistani]]. Found at [[Vistani Park]].

_"The fates are not kind, nor cruel. They simply weave, and I am but the hand that guides the thread."_

##### Goal
Once Strahd is dead, she wants to end the cycle by killing the heroes.

#### **Who is Madame Eva in This Version?**

Madame Eva is a **Vistani seer**, deeply tied to Barovia’s fate. In most versions of _Curse of Strahd_, she is a mysterious fortune-teller who aids the party in their quest to destroy Strahd. In _your_ version, however, she serves **the Elder God**, and her assistance to the party is not about saving Barovia—but about **shattering the last barrier keeping the Elder God imprisoned.**

- She presents herself as **an ally**, guiding the party against Strahd.
- She feeds them **prophecies and tools** needed to weaken him.
- She does this **not out of kindness**, but because Strahd’s rule is **the final tether holding the Elder God at bay.**

Strahd unknowingly maintains a **fragile balance**—his dark pact and his dominion over Barovia act as a form of **containment** for the **Elder God’s influence.** By toppling him, the players unwittingly **weaken the last protections between the world and the abyss.**

---

### **Madame Eva’s True Agenda**

Madame Eva’s visions come **not from the mists, nor from fate, but from the Elder God itself.** She is its chosen prophet, the only mortal in Barovia who truly understands the **cosmic horror lurking beneath the land.**

Her **real goal** is to **restore the Elder God’s influence over Barovia and beyond.** To do this, she must:

1. **Aid the Party in Killing Strahd.** His dark pact keeps the Elder God’s prison intact.
2. **Ensure the Players Unravel the Church of the Eternal Light.** The Church’s doctrines, while corrupt, **unknowingly suppress some of the Elder God’s influence.** Its destruction allows more eldritch horrors to manifest.
3. **Manipulate the Players into Entering the Elder God’s Prison.** At the campaign’s climax, she will guide them **toward the hidden vault that seals the entity away**, saying it is in Strahd's office building. She will tell them they need to "seal away Strahd’s evil forever"—when in truth, they are opening the Elder God’s cage.

She may also **offer them gifts**—boons of knowledge, strange artifacts, or **visions of their future** that tempt them into trusting her. However, the further they delve, the more they realize **her predictions subtly nudge them toward the apocalypse.**

---

### **How Does She Appear to the Players?**

To maintain the illusion of an ally, Madame Eva operates **from the shadows**, only revealing small truths.

- She provides **the Tarokka reading**, but the fortunes she gives subtly push the players toward **weakening Barovia’s remaining defenses.**
- She tells them that the "true darkness" behind Barovia **is not just Strahd** but something older, something _deeper_—implying she is on their side.
- She may **warn them about the Church’s growing power**, telling them that the Church’s “blind faith” is as dangerous as Strahd himself.
- She might **pretend to be afraid of the Elder God**, subtly steering the players **toward its resting place** under the guise of stopping it.

She will only reveal her **true allegiance** in the **final act**, when the Elder God’s cage is breaking.

---

### **Her Role in the Final Battle**

When the party finally **defeats Strahd**, they may believe they have won—only to realize **something is still terribly wrong.**

- The mists **do not lift.** The skies darken. The stars shift into unnatural alignments.
- Madame Eva **appears before them one last time**—perhaps with an expression of quiet reverence, or **ecstatic worship.**
- She **thanks them.** _“You have done what even I could not. You have freed us all.”_
- If the players try to stop her, she fights **as a prophet of the Elder God**, wielding eldritch magic and summoning cosmic horrors.
- If she **succeeds**, she offers the players a **terrible choice**: _join the Elder God in reshaping the world—or be consumed._

---

### **Optional Twists & Player Choices**

- **The Players Could Learn the Truth Early.** If they piece together her true role before the final battle, they might have to **choose between fighting Strahd or stopping Eva first.**
- **Eva’s Plan Might Not Be Fully Realized.** If the players defeat her before Strahd, they might save the world—but still have to contend with the vampire lord’s eternal rule.
- **Eva Offers One Last Bargain.** In the final moments, she may try to sway the party—offering them **forbidden knowledge, power beyond death, or an escape from Barovia—at a terrible cost.**

---

### **Conclusion**

Madame Eva becomes a **pivotal character** in this version of the story—not just a seer, but a **prophet of the apocalypse.** She helps the party, but only as a means to an end, **turning their heroism into the very thing that dooms them.**

### **The Final Confrontation with Madame Eva: The Prophet’s Ascension**

After Strahd is **defeated**, the players expect Barovia to be **free**—but instead, reality begins to **warp.** The sky **fractures**, shadows grow **too long**, and the very ground seems to **breathe.**

In the center of it all, Madame Eva **transcends.**

#### **Phase 1: The Revelation (Roleplay & Horror)**

- The party finds Madame Eva **kneeling before an altar of pulsating flesh and black stone.**
- She is **chanting**, her body glowing with an **eerie cosmic light**.
- She welcomes the players **not as enemies, but as liberators.**
- She **thanks them.** _“You have done what even I could not. You have freed us all.”_
- She offers them a choice:
    - _"Kneel, and become heralds of the Great Awakening."_
    - _"Or fight, and be the last souls to perish in this dying dream."_

If the players **reject her offer**, her **body tears apart**—revealing something **not wholly human anymore.**

#### **Phase 2: Battle Against the Prophet**

Madame Eva is no longer just **a mortal woman**—she has become **the Prophet of the Elder God**, an entity infused with reality-warping power.

- The battle takes place in a **shifting nightmare realm**—Barovia itself is coming undone.
- **Terrain distorts**, shifting **between solid ground, floating islands, and abyssal voids.**
- **Gravity falters**, forcing players to navigate unpredictable movement.
- The Prophet **summons horrors**—writhing **aberrant creatures** claw their way out of the abyss.
- The longer the fight continues, the **more unstable reality becomes.** If the players **fail to end her quickly**, the Elder God **fully manifests.**

**Madame Eva’s form is ever-shifting and incomplete**, as if your eyes refuse to comprehend her fully. Her body is made of overlapping **transparent silhouettes of herself**, each offset by a second or two, constantly murmuring different fates or truths.

**Visual Theme**
Rather than limbs or physical weapons, **Madame Eva attacks by revealing glimpses of impossible knowledge**:
- Her **chest cavity is a mirror**, reflecting players' worst fears or memories.  
- Her **eyes multiply**, or appear in unnatural places—on her palms, floating beside her, blinking behind her.
- When she speaks, **dozens of mouths open across her form**, each voicing a different prophecy in different tones.

**Aesthetic Direction Summary**

|Theme Element|Description|
|---|---|
|**Body**|Multiple translucent copies of herself, desynced slightly, echoing conflicting futures.|
|**Attacks**|Psychic and perceptual manipulation—shifting reality, false reflections, fear and confusion.|
|**Visual Motif**|Mirrors, eyes in unnatural places, shattered time/space, porcelain breaking to reveal void.|
|**Iconic Power**|Splits minds or selves, locks enemies into twisted internal landscapes, prophesies their doom.|

**Additional Visual Cues**
- When she’s injured, **instead of bleeding**, pieces of her **fall away like broken porcelain**, revealing a dark starfield beneath.  
- She flickers like an **old film reel** stuttering between frames.
- Her **voice overlaps** with itself, as if played on multiple gramophones just slightly out of sync.

### **Eldritch Reality (Lair Trait)**

At the start of each of the Prophet’s turns, roll a d6 and apply one of the following effects to the battlefield (lasting until her next turn):  
1-2: _Gravity Reversal._ All creatures must make a **DC 18 Strength saving throw** or be flung **40 feet upward.**  
3-4: _Fractured Time._ All creatures roll a **d6.** On a 1-2, they **lose their next action**. On a 5-6, they gain **an extra action** instead.  
5-6: _Reality Shift._ The battlefield changes terrain drastically (void rifts, floating islands, shifting walls of flesh). **Players must make DC 16 Acrobatics or Dexterity saves** to avoid being thrown into hazards.

---

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** The Prophet makes three attacks: one with **Eldritch Tendrils**, one with **Mind Rend**, and one with **Unravel Form.**

**Fractured Echoes**

_Melee Spell Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target
- **Hit:** 22 (4d6 + 6) necrotic damage
- The target must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or become **"Split"**—they gain **disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks** as their perception is divided across multiple realities. At the end of each of their turns, they can make the saving throw again.
> _Flavor_: A semi-transparent afterimage of the Prophet swipes through the target like a warped echo, and the target sees dozens of slightly different versions of themselves reacting in delayed sequence.

**Mind Rend.** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +14 to hit, range 90 ft., one creature.
- **Hit:** 36 (6d8 + 7) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a **DC 18 Intelligence saving throw** or be **stunned** until the end of its next turn.

**Unravel Form.** _Melee Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
- **Hit:** 30 (5d10 + 5) force damage, and the target must make a **DC 19 Constitution saving throw** or lose **1d4 spell slots or 1d4 maximum hit points** (DM’s choice).

---

### **Legendary Actions (3/Turn)**

The Prophet can take **3 legendary actions**, choosing from the options below. Only one can be used at a time, and only at the **end of another creature’s turn.**

- **Whispers of the Elder One (Costs 1 Action).** The Prophet **targets one creature within 60 feet**. The target must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or be **charmed** for 1 minute, believing the Prophet is their **true savior.** The target can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.
- **Flesh into Darkness (Costs 2 Actions).** The Prophet **phases into an alternate reality**, becoming **immune to all damage** until the start of her next turn.
- **Shattered Reflection (Costs 3 Actions)**. The Prophet **manifests shards of broken reality** in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in the area must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw**. On a failure, they are pulled into their **own twisted reflection** and are **banished** to a mirrored void for 1 round (as _banishment_, but flavored as psychological imprisonment). On a success, they take **4d8 psychic damage** from resisting the pull.

---

### **Phase 3: The Final Collapse**

At **30 HP**, the Prophet enters her **last phase.**

- **Her body shatters**—revealing a swirling **gateway to the Elder God’s prison.**
- The battlefield becomes **completely unstable.**
- The party is sucked into the **Amber Temple**

---

### **Ending Possibilities**

1. **The Party Kills Her & Escapes.** They barely make it out before the Elder God fully manifests. The mists remain, but Barovia may yet be saved.
2. **They Fail to Stop the Ritual.** The Elder God emerges, warping reality into a **twisted, cosmic nightmare.** The party must fight something even **worse than Strahd.**
3. **They Accept Eva’s Offer.** The party chooses to **join the Elder God**, reshaping Barovia into a realm of eldritch horror.

---

### **Final Thoughts**

This ending blends **cosmic horror, reality-warping mechanics, and combat** into a truly **mind-bending showdown.** It’s not just about **defeating Eva**—it’s about surviving as reality **falls apart around them.**
