### **Role in Barovia City**
Baba Lysaga is a **powerful cult leader and high priestess of the Elder God**, one of the most devoted followers of its will. She commands a **fanatical sect** that operates in the shadows of Barovia City, slowly **eroding the protections Strahd put in place** to keep the Elder God from fully manifesting.

She has an **innate connection to the Mist**, able to manipulate it in ways others cannot. It whispers to her, guides her, and she can even **shape it to form deadly illusions, eldritch horrors, or trap unsuspecting victims in a waking nightmare**.

---

### **Baba Lysaga & Strahd – Their Connection**
- **A Meeting in the Mist:** When Strahd first **staggered ashore**, irrevocably **changed by the Elder God**, it was **Baba Lysaga who found him**. She recognized him as something **not fully human**, a being **touched by the eldritch** yet still **clinging to his own will**.
- **Mentorship in the Dark Arts:** She **took him under her wing**, believing that he was **destined to be the Elder God's Harbinger**. She **taught him eldritch rituals, how to harness the power of the Mist, and the secrets of the Old World**.
- **The Betrayal:** But when Strahd realized **what the Elder God truly was**, he **rejected her teachings** and **used that knowledge to seal the entity away**, turning Barovia City into a **prison, rather than a gateway**.
- **Her Revenge:** Baba Lysaga never **forgave him**. To her, Strahd is the **false prophet**, the **one who should have been their champion** but instead became **a warden**. She has spent **decades working against him**, chipping away at the barriers he set up.

---

### **Baba Lysaga’s Agenda**
Her ultimate goal is to **undo Strahd’s protections and release the Elder God upon Barovia City**. She believes the Mist should not be a **barrier**, but a **gateway**.

To achieve this, she:
- **Corrupts the Dream Walkers** to infiltrate Barovia City and spread the influence of the Elder God.
- **Performs ancient rituals** that weaken the seals Strahd has put in place.
- **Influences key figures** (politicians, crime families, cultists) to turn against Strahd and **disrupt his control over the city**.
- **Breeds monstrosities in the depths of the Mist**, using them as her personal enforcers.

---

### **Her Lair – The Heart of the Mist**
Baba Lysaga doesn’t reside in a typical building. Her "home" is an **ever-shifting mass of mist and shadow**, a **hidden temple deep within the fog** that exists in **a liminal space between reality and nightmare**.

- The entrance is never in the same place twice—only those who know the correct **eldritch chants** can find it.
- Inside, the walls seem **alive**, pulsing like something **breathing**, and the deeper one ventures, the **less real** the world feels.
- The temple is **littered with relics of forgotten civilizations**, showing that Baba Lysaga’s faith in the Elder God **predates even Strahd’s arrival**.

---

### **How the Party Encounters Her**
- She may **first appear in dreams**, using the Mist to **communicate through nightmares**, whispering **temptations or threats**.
- She plays a big part in [[The Bootlegger's Last Run]].
- If the party **interferes with her cult**, she **sends horrors from the Mist** to hunt them.
- **At some point**, the party will need to venture into **the heart of the Mist** to stop her from **breaking Strahd’s seals completely**.

---

### **Possible Encounter Ideas**
- **A City in Fog** – Baba Lysaga **blankets a section of Barovia City in supernatural fog**, trapping the party inside and **forcing them to confront twisted visions of their past**.
- **The Ritual of Awakening** – The party **stumbles upon a mass sacrifice**, an attempt to **open a true rift to the Elder God’s realm**.
- **The Final Confrontation** – In her mist-covered sanctum, she **merges with the eldritch fog itself**, forcing the party to fight her **and the Mist-made horrors she commands**.

---

### **Her Powers & Abilities**
- **Mist Manipulation** – She can **summon and control the Mist**, shaping it into **claws, tentacles, and ghostly figures**.
- **Eldritch Corruption** – She can **implant nightmarish whispers into a victim’s mind**, forcing them to act against their will.
- **Mistform** – She can become **one with the fog**, making her nearly impossible to hit unless the party dispels the Mist.
- **Reality Warping** – In her domain, **nothing is stable**—the party might find the ground shifting, doors leading to impossible places, or their own thoughts betraying them.

---

### **Conclusion – Her Role in the Story**
Baba Lysaga is the **primary agent working against Strahd**, not out of **righteous rebellion**, but because she believes **he is the greatest failure of the Elder God’s will**.

She is **both a major antagonist and a looming presence**, one who **represents the full force of the eldritch horrors trying to break through into Barovia City**.
