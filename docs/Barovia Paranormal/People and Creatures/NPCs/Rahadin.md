Sadistic chamberlain to [[_The Zarovich Family]] for centuries. Unwavering in loyalty to [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]. Found in [[The Lofts]].

Rahadin, the dusk elf chamberlain of the Lofts, has served the Zarovich family faithfully for nearly five hundred years. He is Strahd's eternal servant, a longtime comrade-in-arms, and a ruthless warrior who has killed thousands in his lifetime.

**Exile**. Rahadin was exiled for refusing to bow down to a dusk elf prince whom he considered weak and corrupt. When the dusk elves later declined to pay fealty to Strahd, Rahadin helped Strahd conquer them. The elf kingdom's royal line was obliterated, the dusk elves hunted like rabbits. The few that survived were either subjugated or forced to live among the Vistani. So pleased was Strahd with Rahadin that the don made the dusk elf an honorary member of his family.

**Chamberlain**. Rahadin continued to fight as one of Strahd's generals, fighting back forces that wished to weaken Strahd's hold on the Elder God. When the wars ended and Strahd turned his attention to building Castle Ravenloft, which then was transformed into The Lofts. Rahadin saw Years later, Strahd appointed Rahadin his chamberlain and second in command of his underground crime family. Rahadin was pleased to do whatever Strahd asked of him, and he instilled terror in the crime family underlings by routinely flogging those who didn't perform their duties to his exacting standards.

**Screams of the Dead**. So dreadful a creature is Rahadin that anyone who stands within 10 feet of him can hear the howling screams of the countless men and women he has killed in his lifetime. Ra had in can't hear them, nor would he be haunted by them if he could. The only thing he cares about is Strahd von Zarovich, for whom he would gladly give his life.

Leads the party to Dinner with Strahd.

In the Lofts, right before final encounter, Rahadan approaches quietly. A character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds Rahadin's Dexterity (Stealth) check hear him.

>"The master wishes to see you," intones a grim voice in
the darkness.

Rahadin will then direct the party to a random area, even if Strahd's not there. He then gives vague directions to where they need to go, but not lead them.

If found in his office in the Lofts, he will lure them in and try to kill them. There is also a shadow demon in his office that will engage in the fight. The character doesn't notice the demon, unless the character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds the demon's Dexterity (Stealth) check. Both Rahadin and the shadow demon fight until slain.

If Strahd dies but Rahadin yet lives, the dusk elf chamberlain appears moments after Strahd's demise. When that occurs, read:

>"Master!" says a voice from behind you. An elf with dusky brown skin and long black hair, his face a mask of terror, looks on what you have wrought and screams.

Rahadin has served Strahd's family for hundreds of years and doesn't take his master's defeat well. The dusk elf chamberlain draws his scimitar and tries to avenge Strahd. Grief-stricken, he can't be reasoned with.
