A bloodthirsty and dirty cop tied to [[_The Vallakovich Family]].

His right arm was severed on duty a long time ago. It gave him PTSD and he was treated in [[St. Markovia Sanitorium]] where he received a new arm from [[The Abbot]] and was shortly discharged. The arm is from a large gorilla. He tries to hide the arm as much as possible.

Izek does Don Vargas Vallakovich's bidding.

Izek is not afraid to push around his weight, even threatening the party for any reason he can find.

Will head the hunt for the sabretooth tiger in [[Tyger, Tyger]].

If the Vallakovich family or the precinct falls, he will flee to another district and try to hide. Likely locations include [[The Old Bonegrinder Mill]], [[The Fog Lantern]], or the ruins of [[Berez]].
