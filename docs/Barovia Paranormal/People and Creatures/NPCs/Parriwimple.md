Nephew of [[Bildrath Cantemir]]. Works as stockboy at [[Bildrath's]].

If the characters give Bildrath a hard time, he calls Parriwimple (LG male human), his nephew and stockboy, to help him out. Parriwimple has the statistics of a gladiator, except that he has an Intelligence of 6 and doesn't carry a shield (AC 14). Parriwimple's real name is Parpol Cantemir, but no one in the village calls him that. His muscles rippling beneath his leather tunic should give ample notice of his strength. At the same time, Parriwimple is simple-minded. He is devoted to his uncle and will not follow the characters as long as Bildrath has something to say about it.
