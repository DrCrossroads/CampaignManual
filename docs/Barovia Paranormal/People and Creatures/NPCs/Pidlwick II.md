Creation of [[Gadof Blinsky]], who he hates. Found in [[Blinsky's Whimsy Workshop]].

Pidlwick II is **not just a creepy automaton—he was Gadof’s greatest failure.**
- He was **meant to be Blinsky’s masterpiece**, a **fully autonomous, soul-infused toy.**
- But **the soul inside was too broken**—a child’s spirit, warped by the trauma of death.
- Pidlwick II **became bloodthirsty**, **killing Blinsky’s other creations out of jealousy.**
- Now, he **hates Blinsky, but he still craves his approval**. If the party **turns him against Blinsky**, he may help them—**but at a terrible cost.**
