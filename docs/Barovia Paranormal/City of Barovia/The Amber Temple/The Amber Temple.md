## **Updating the Amber Temple → The Sunken Prison of the Eye**

- The **temple is deep underwater**, its entrance located in a sunken ruin beneath the Barovian Sea.
- The **architecture is alien**, covered in carvings of tentacles and eldritch symbols that seem to shift when not being watched.
- The temple is **not entirely submerged**, but **certain sections are flooded** or require traversal using broken bridges, ancient mechanisms, and magic.
- Strange **fish-like humanoids** (deep ones, thralls of the Elder God) lurk in the depths, protecting the temple from outsiders.
- The **prison itself is a vast abyss**, its depths impossible to see. Chains of light and eldritch runes **hold the Elder God at bay**, but they are **cracking**.
- The temple contains **ancient tomes and murals** that explain the cycle of the Elder God's imprisonment and the **consequences of its release**.

## **MAP OVERVIEW**

The **Sunken Prison of the Eye** is divided into **four major sections**, culminating in **The Abyssal Core**, where the party will make their fateful choice.

1. **The Drowned Gate** – The grand, shattered entrance and its drowned guardians.
2. **The Labyrinth of Echoes** – Twisting, shifting halls filled with memories of past cycles.
3. **The Maw of the Sleeper** – A vast chasm, where eldritch beasts lurk in the depths.
4. **The Abyssal Core** – The prison itself, where the Elder God is bound.

### **DM Note**
The **Sunken Prison of the Eye** is meant to feel **ancient, hostile, and utterly alien**—a place **not meant for mortals to tread**. Every step should reinforce the **cosmic horror** of what lurks beneath. The players should constantly feel **watched, insignificant, and uncertain** if their choices will make any difference at all.

---

## **1. THE DROWNED GATE** (Entry)

### **Description:**

The entrance to the temple is a **half-sunken ruin**, its massive doors long broken, allowing **cold abyssal water** to seep inside. A massive staircase descends into the temple’s depths, lined with **statues of hooded figures**, their faces **eroded beyond recognition**. Above the entrance, a shattered relief depicts an **unblinking eye**, its pupil extending out in sharp, alien spirals.

**Atmosphere:**

- The air is **thick with moisture**, and **small fish** swim through pockets of open space.
- The walls seem to **shift and breathe**, their surfaces covered in **incomprehensible symbols** that pulse with an eerie blue glow.
- A deep, thrumming **heartbeat-like sound** echoes from below.

**Encounters & Hazards:**

- **Guardian Thralls (Twisted Aberrant Thralls)** – The remains of previous explorers and prisoners, now bound to the Elder God’s will.
- **Flooded Pits** – Some floors are weakened, dropping victims into pools filled with **amphibious horrors**.
- **Whispers from the Deep** – Every **hour** spent in this area requires a **DC 16 Wisdom save** to resist intrusive thoughts of drowning, spiraling into madness.

_“The waterlogged descent opens into an immense chamber, its architecture alien and oppressive. The vaulted ceiling, barely visible through thick mist, is inscribed with spiraling glyphs that pulse faintly with an eerie blue glow. The stone floor is slick with briny moisture, forming shallow pools that reflect the shifting light from the walls. At the center of the room, shattered against the steps of an immense altar, lies a wooden ship—its hull cracked, its mast broken. The vessel is ancient, its wood swollen and blackened from time untold, yet impossibly preserved by the temple’s eldritch influence. Around it, six decayed bodies rest, their flesh leathery, frozen in death as though they perished only yesterday.”_

### **Key Features & Interactions**

###### **1. The Crashed Ship - The Forsaken Vessel**

- The ship appears **not of Barovian origin**, more resembling a **deep-sea exploration craft**, though it bears **no known insignia**.
- **Eldritch barnacles** coat its hull, some still pulsating, as if half-alive. Touching them causes brief **visions of drowning in an endless void** (DC 15 Wisdom save or suffer one level of exhaustion).
- The captain’s log, **if found intact**, is written in an unrecognizable language but radiates a **faint psychic resonance**.
    - Players may decipher it with **Comprehend Languages**, revealing fragmented notes of a **voyage to find the "Sunken Eye”** before descending into **mad ramblings**.
- If disturbed, **shadows of the crew** (wraith-like entities) flicker along the walls but do not attack—yet.

###### **2. The Six Preserved Bodies**

- **Positioning** – The bodies are **arranged in a semi-circle** as if they died **gazing up at the altar** behind the crashed vessel.
- **Examination** – A DC 16 Medicine check reveals their **bones are thousands of years old**, but their **bodies are perfectly preserved**, as though trapped in time.
- **Tatyana’s Corpse** – One of the bodies, a **red-haired woman in noble attire**, bears an **unmistakable resemblance to Tatyana**, whose likeness appears in paintings within Castle Ravenloft.
    - **Recognition:** If a player has seen her portraits or met **Ireena**, they immediately recognize the resemblance.
    - **Tatyana’s Ring** – On her skeletal finger, a **gold ring bearing a raven insignia**. If taken, a voice echoes: _"Not again..."_ before the ring vanishes, returning to her hand moments later.
    - If resurrected or interacted with via **Speak with Dead**, she utters cryptic warnings of **cycles repeating, drowning, and being lost in the dark between stars**.

---

The **Drowned Gate** is more than just a chamber—it’s a **crossroads**, leading deeper into the **Sunken Prison of the Eye**. Corridors extend outward, filled with **ominous relics, shifting shadows, and hidden dangers**.

### **Chambers & Corridors**

##### **The Altar of the Blind Watcher** (Far Corridor)
- **A massive, cracked stone altar** sits at the far end of the chamber, **half-submerged** in murky, stagnant water.
- The relief above it **depicts an unblinking eye**, its spiral pupil **filled with jagged, unrecognizable symbols**.
- A **sacrificial dagger**, rusted but still sharp, rests atop the altar. Holding it **causes whispers to fill the wielder’s mind**, urging them to _"see beyond sight."_
- If a character **spills their blood upon the altar**, they gain **brief insight into the temple’s layout** but also suffer **1d10 psychic damage** and a lingering feeling of _being watched_.
- There are two egresses in the far side of the chamber and one on the left.

###### Chambers connected to The Altar of the Blind Watcher
###### **The Chamber of Black Light**
- A **vast, dome-like chamber** with walls covered in pulsating, **bioluminescent veins** that emit a soft, **ultraviolet glow**.
- As the party steps inside, their **shadows stretch unnaturally** against the walls, moving independently.
- **Strange floating motes of darkness** drift through the air, reacting to movement.
- Any light source **dims and bends**, making the room **hard to navigate** (disadvantage on Perception checks).
- **A forgotten artifact** (a sphere covered in spirals) rests in the center. If touched, the shadows **rush toward the player**, wrapping around them before vanishing.
    - **Effect:** The player can now **see in complete darkness** but has disadvantage against **psychic attacks** while in the temple.
###### **The Vault of Sight**
- A **small, circular room** with a **stone pedestal in the center**. Upon it sits a **large, floating eye**, its **pupil shifting like a whirlpool**.
- The **walls are carved with thousands of staring eyes**, some **closed, some open**.
- If a player approaches, the floating eye **focuses on them**, and they feel as though **something enormous is watching from beyond reality**.
- **Interaction:** If a character **stares into the eye**, they make a **DC 17 Wisdom saving throw**:
    - **Success:** They receive a **brief vision of the temple’s layout** and can locate **a hidden passage** to the Labyrinth of Echoes.
    - **Failure:** Their **own eyes go temporarily blind**, and they **see themselves standing in this room—but from a perspective outside their body** for 1d4 minutes.
###### **The Chamber of Dissonance** _(Passage to The Labyrinth of Echoes)_
- A **long hallway** lined with **cracked mirrors**, each reflecting **a different version of the party** (some appear drowned, some lost, some…missing).
- As they step further inside, **their own reflections distort**, speaking to them in **whispers from alternate timelines**.
- The **hallway gradually stretches**, becoming **impossibly long** unless the players **shut their eyes** and move forward blindly.
- **At the end of the hall**, a **mirror doorway pulses**, leading into **Area 2: The Labyrinth of Echoes**.
****

##### **The Submerged Archives** _(Right Corridor)_
- A **long, sloping hallway descends into knee-deep water**, leading to what appears to be a **library**, its shelves warped and covered in coral-like growths.
- **Books are unreadable**, their pages **filled with writhing black ink** that moves when observed.
- Among the debris, a **watertight silver chest** contains **a journal from a past cycle**, detailing the experiences of a lost explorer who came close to **breaking the cycle** but failed.
- **Trap – The Drowned Scribes**: If players linger too long, the water begins to **rise unnaturally**, and shadowy figures (the former scribes) **attempt to pull them under**.

###### Chambers connected to The Submerged Archives
###### **The Hall of Silent Tomes**
- A **vast library**, the **shelves twisted** as if melted by extreme heat.
- The books **appear to be made of skin**, stitched together with **black thread**.
- Reading the books results in **no sound**, as though reality itself refuses to acknowledge their existence.
- If a player attempts to **read aloud**, **they lose the ability to speak** for 1 hour.
- **A hidden alcove** in the back contains a **sealed scroll**, written in a **language no one understands**—not even magic can decipher it.
###### **The Drowned Scriptorium**
- A **circular writing chamber**, **half-flooded**, with **floating desks and chairs**.
- The water is **inky black**, forming **letters and symbols** on its surface when disturbed.
- A **quill levitates**, attempting to write words on a soaked, crumbling parchment.
- If a player touches the quill, it **writes their fate** in an unknown tongue, causing **1d6 psychic damage** and giving them **a prophecy about their future**.
- A **dead scribe** is slumped over a desk, holding a **key to a locked chamber elsewhere** in the temple.
###### **The Chamber of Forgotten Names**
- The walls here are **etched with thousands of names**, many **scratched out** or **half-erased**.
- As the players enter, **their own names appear on the walls**, glowing faintly.
- A stone pedestal in the center holds a **massive tome**, bound in something **that breathes**.
- If opened, the tome **begins to rewrite the players’ histories**, altering small details of their pasts.
- **A player who lingers too long** must make a **DC 18 Charisma saving throw** or **forget the last five minutes**, which can only be restored by finding the name deeper in the temple.
###### **The Room of Endless Footsteps**
- A **hallway where footsteps echo constantly**, even when standing still.
- No one is ever sure if the **footsteps belong to them or someone else**.
- Players who walk through find themselves **briefly appearing in other parts of the temple**, as though reality **overlaps in this space**.
- This hallway connects to the **Hall of Lamenting Statues**, but cannot be opened from that room.
****

##### **The Hall of Empty Eyes** _(Left Corridor)_
 - **A hall lined with tall, eyeless statues**, each missing their face entirely.
 - A pressure plate trap at the center **activates the statues**, causing their faces to distort into **screaming voids**.
 - Those caught in the trap **lose all vision for 1 minute**, perceiving **only the deep abyss** instead.
 - **Secret:** If a player places **Tatyana’s ring** into the hands of the central statue, a hidden passage opens, leading to a **sarcophagus of a forgotten priest**, containing a **key to the Abyssal Core**.

###### Chambers connected to The Hall of Empty Eyes
###### **The Hall of Lamenting Statues**
- This corridor is **lined with humanoid statues**, all appearing to be **crying**, their **stone faces twisted in grief**.
- Every few steps, a **different sound of weeping echoes**, though no one is actually crying.
- If touched, the statues **scream silently**, forcing a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or causing **deafness for 10 minutes**.
- The **last statue in the hall** holds **an actual, physical tear**—a blue crystal that can cure **one madness effect**.
###### **The Chamber of the Faceless Choir**
- A **massive, domed room**, its ceiling vanishing into **unnatural darkness**.
- **Dozens of hooded figures** kneel in circles, **humming** an eerie, discordant tune.
- Approaching them reveals that **they have no faces**—only blank, stretched skin.
- If disturbed, **their humming grows louder**, and the players must make a **DC 17 Wisdom saving throw** or become **entranced, unable to move for 1 minute**.
- The music **warps time**, making it difficult to **judge how long they’ve been in the temple**.
###### **The Hall of the Devoured Light**
- A **pitch-black chamber** where **no light functions**—torches **snuff out**, and darkvision **fails completely**.
- As the players step inside, **their own shadows attack them**, manifesting as **wispy, wraith-like figures**.
- A single, **pulsing sigil** at the center of the room can be **pressed to restore the light**, but doing so **brands** the player with a **burning eye sigil** on their palm.
- The brand **grants the ability to detect lies** but also **makes them visible to the temple’s deeper horrors**.
###### **The Chamber of the Drowned King**
- A **throne room**, completely submerged except for a single, dry platform.
- A **skeletal king in a waterlogged robe** sits upon the throne, **his head missing**.
- A sign reads: _"He sees through your eyes now."_
- If the players disturb the throne, **their reflections in water begin moving on their own**, sometimes showing **horrific alternate versions of themselves**.

### Hidden Chambers
###### **The Pool of Reflection**
- A dark, **mirror-like pool** in a concealed room. Looking into it **reveals visions of past adventurers**, including glimpses of the party **dying in different ways**.
- If a character **touches the water**, they are momentarily **pulled into the vision**, experiencing a **fragment of their death** (they do not die but suffer **psychic backlash**).
- The pool also holds **an artifact—a small, golden eye amulet**, which allows its wearer to **foresee impending danger (advantage on initiative)** but at the cost of **hallucinations of drowning** at random intervals.
###### **The Watcher’s Garden**
- A **strange cavern-like chamber**, filled with **eyeball-shaped growths** on **blackened vines**.
- The eyes **blink in unison**, watching the players as they pass.
- Cutting one causes **all the eyes to scream**, forcing a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or inflicting **temporary insanity**.
- At the far end, an **ancient gateway leads deeper into the temple**. This gateway leads to **The Vault of Sight**, but disappears once they cross through.
****

#### **Traps & Hazards**

1. **Waterlogged Passageways**
    - Some corridors are **half-submerged**, but the **water is deceptive**—at random intervals, it **rises unnaturally**, threatening to drown those who linger.
2. **Whispers of the Drowned**
    - At random intervals, players must make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or hear a voice say, _"You’ve been here before. You will drown here again."_ Those who fail suffer **1 level of exhaustion** as panic sets in.
3. **The Watchful Glyphs**
    - Some walls bear **glowing, spiraling glyphs**. Observing them for too long causes a **DC 16 Intelligence save** or the character becomes **paralyzed for 1 minute**, caught in a trance of **visions from past cycles**.
****

#### **Dynamic Elements & Unique Mechanics**

- **The Temple Remembers** – Any **items left behind** in the Drowned Gate **disappear when players leave**, swallowed by the shifting temple.
- **Time Feels Wrong** – Players **lose track of how long they’ve been inside**, and watches, timepieces, and even spell durations **become unreliable**.
- **Death Echoes** – If a party member dies here, **the temple keeps a reflection of their death**, which future visitors may witness.
****

## **2. THE LABYRINTH OF ECHOES** (The Memory Maze)

### **Description:**
*A twisting, shifting nightmare of impossible geometry and echoes of time long past. The walls murmur secrets, the air pulses with unseen energies, and the laws of reality bend. The deeper the players go, the more they question if they will ever find their way out—or if they already have, in some other timeline.*

This section consists of **shifting corridors and chambers** that **warp reality**, creating an ever-changing **maze of lost souls**. Water drips **upward**, and shadows **move independently of their sources**. The party will encounter **echoes of past victims**—faded, **half-real figures** replaying the moments before their deaths, trapped in an endless cycle.

##### **General Mechanics & Atmosphere:**

- The walls sometimes become **transparent**, revealing **otherworldly horrors staring back**.
- Doors and hallways **shift when not observed**, leading the party deeper into the unknown.
- **Shifting Gravity:** Some rooms rotate without warning, forcing players to walk on ceilings, walls, or even inside twisting tunnels that fold in on themselves.
- **Temporal Distortions:** Players occasionally catch **glimpses of themselves** from a few seconds in the future, or they see **the room ahead repeating infinitely**, only to find that time snaps back into place.
- **Echoing Voices:** Whispers follow the party, sometimes speaking in **their own voices** but saying things they never said.
- **False Pathways:** Some corridors **loop endlessly** unless specific conditions are met—walking backward, closing their eyes, or speaking the name of someone they’ve lost.
- **The Stalkers:** Unseen entities move just beyond the party’s vision. They leave **distorted shadows** flickering on the walls but disappear when directly observed.

**Encounters & Hazards:**

- **Echoes of the Doomed** – Apparitions attempt to **possess the living**, forcing **DC 17 Charisma saves** to resist their despair.
- **Abyssal Stalkers** – Invisible **eldritch parasites** (similar to intellect devourers) **latch onto players’ shadows**, feeding off their sanity.

### **Key Areas in the Labyrinth**
These areas are completely random, as the players continue through the labyrinth roll a d8 to determine which area they enter. The party must continue through four unique areas before they can exit the labyrinth.

###### **1. The Corridor of Collapsing Time**
- The entrance is a **long, spiraling passageway**, appearing as though it's **melting in slow motion**.
- **Mechanic:** The further they walk, the **more their reflections in the walls change**—first they appear normal, then **younger**, then **older**, then **distorted versions of themselves**.
- If they linger too long, the hallway **snaps shut**, and they must make a **DC 16 Dexterity save** to avoid being _swallowed_ into another timeline.

###### **2. The Inverted Sanctum**
- A **circular chamber** where **gravity shifts unexpectedly**.
- Upon entering, players feel themselves **falling upward**, landing on what should be the ceiling.
- Walking through the room is disorienting, as gravity **randomly changes** every 30 seconds.
- **Puzzle:** A series of **floating platforms** must be navigated while the players’ **own shadows attack them**, forcing them to battle themselves.

###### **3. The Endless Hallway**
- A **long, stone corridor**, appearing normal at first.
- As the players walk, they realize **they never seem to reach the end**.
- **Trick:** If they turn around, they see **their own backs moving away from them**, as if they had never turned.
- **Solution:** To exit, they must **step through their own shadow** on the floor.

###### **4. The Chamber of Forgotten Names**
- A **vast, circular room** with **floating, inscribed stone tablets** that drift in the air.
- Every few seconds, a name **carves itself into a tablet** before being erased.
- Players who stay too long **forget their own names** until reminded by another.
- **Danger:** The stalkers **watch from the shadows**, mimicking the players’ voices in an attempt to lure them away.

###### **5. The Rift of Reflections**
- A **mirror-walled passage**, flickering between **infinite reflections** of the party.
- Some reflections **lag behind** or **move differently**, as if trapped in another time.
- Occasionally, **one reflection does not belong**—a twisted version of a player grins from a distance.
- **Trap:** If players step too close to their reflections, **one may try to pull them in**, swapping places.

###### **6. The Maw of the Dreaming Void** _(False Pathway Leading to a Dead End)_
- A **gaping, black void** sits at the end of an **impossibly long tunnel**.
- As the party approaches, they feel as though **they are being watched from within the darkness**.
- If they stare into it for too long, they must make a **DC 18 Wisdom save** or become **entranced**, stepping forward into nothingness.
- **If they fall in**, they wake up **standing back at the Labyrinth’s entrance**, as if nothing had happened.

###### **7. The Steps Between Realities**
- A **set of massive stone stairs**, leading **both up and down at the same time** (depending on the perspective).
- At the top/bottom, a **golden door pulses**, but it **constantly flickers between existing and not existing**.
- **Mechanic:** Players can only step through the door **when their shadows perfectly align with it**—forcing them to move in unnatural ways.
- **The Stalkers lurk nearby**, their silhouettes shifting in the corners of vision.

###### **8. The Chamber of the Wandering Moons**
- A **massive, dark void**, above which **three glowing orbs—like miniature moons—drift**.
- These moons **cycle through phases**, affecting the environment:
    - **Full Moon:** Everything is illuminated, and reality is stable.
    - **New Moon:** The room becomes an infinite abyss.
    - **Eclipse:** Players **swap places with versions of themselves from other timelines**.
- To pass through, they must **align the moons into the correct pattern** by manipulating the room’s strange gravity shifts.
****

#### Hidden Chamber
###### **The Graveyard of the Unmade** _(Hidden Room - Players Must Hear the Echo of Its Name in Another Room First)_
- A **vast cavern filled with broken statues**, half-formed figures, and **mangled remnants of people who never were**.
- The **air pulses with forgotten memories**, making players **recall things that never happened**.
- **Trap:** A powerful entity, **The Unborn One**, whispers tempting truths about their past, offering to **"remake" them into something greater**.
- Accepting its deal **rewrites the player’s backstory**, potentially altering their abilities permanently.
****

#### Last Chamber
The players must enter at least four unique areas before they can enter the following area.
###### **The Doorway of Seven Echoes** _(Exit to the Next Area)_
- A **massive, ornate stone doorway**, sealed by **seven locks**, each corresponding to an **echo** in the Labyrinth.
- Players must **find and trigger the correct echoes** (ghostly images of past travelers) to **unlock** the way forward.
- **The Stalkers will fully emerge here**, attempting to **stop them before they reach the exit**.
- Upon opening the door, the players step into **a void-like space**, leading into the **next area of the Sunken Prison.**

---

## **3. THE MAW OF THE SLEEPER** (The Great Chasm)

### **Description:**

This massive chamber features a **bottomless abyss**, with crumbling bridges and **massive stone chains** leading downward. Strange **luminescent creatures** drift through the air, forming **patterns that resemble unblinking eyes**. Below, **something titanic shifts** in the darkness, its **tentacles coiling around the stone pillars**.

**Atmosphere:**

- The further the party descends, the more they feel a **pressure on their minds**—as if something **ancient and immense** is watching them.
- A **low, droning sound** vibrates the very stone beneath their feet.
- The chains that **hold the Elder God’s prison are here**, cracked but still intact.

**Encounters & Hazards:**

- **Falling into the Abyss** – If a character falls, they plummet **into an endless void**, emerging somewhere **impossible** (e.g., inside a memory, in another room, or missing for an hour before reappearing with **something watching them**).
- **Eldritch Leviathan** – A **massive, slumbering horror** lies at the bottom of the abyss. If disturbed, **tentacles lash out** randomly, forcing **DC 18 Dexterity saves** or **restraining** their victims.
- **The Last Gatekeeper** – A dying **herald of the Elder God** remains bound here, offering **cryptic warnings**—or, if the party proves a threat, **fighting to keep them from breaking the cycle**.

---

## **4. THE ABYSSAL CORE** (The Final Chamber)

### **Description:**

A vast, **circular chamber**, the prison itself is a massive **stone sphere, suspended by enormous chains**. Inside, a **seething black mass of eyes and tentacles pulses**, restrained by **cracked sigils of light**. Floating stone platforms circle the prison, providing a path to the **final sigil altar**, where the choice must be made.

**Atmosphere:**
- The **walls of reality thin**, revealing **glimpses of past and future cycles** as the party approaches.
- The Elder God **whispers directly into their minds**, offering **deals, insights, and lies**.
- The **portal above the chamber** flickers, showing glimpses of the **cosmic horror beyond the stars**.

### **The Final Choice**

The party must choose:

1. **Restart the Cycle** – By **rekindling the ancient sigils**, they seal the Elder God away once more, ensuring **another cycle of doomed repetition**.
2. **Choose a Warden** – The party must choose a warden to take Strahd's place. That player will essentially become an Eldritch Lich.
    - The temple **begins repairing itself**, and the players are **cast out into a reset Barovia**, remembering only fragments of what happened.

3. **End the Cycle** – By **destroying the final sigil**, they **break the prison**, allowing Kth'Vulgaroth to awaken fully, triggering the final battle.
    - The **temple begins to collapse**, the waters **rushing in**, and the **portal above widens**, signaling the end of all things.


If players choose to **END THE CYCLE**, The will face off against [[CR14 Kth'Vulgaroth, The Eye of the Depths]]
