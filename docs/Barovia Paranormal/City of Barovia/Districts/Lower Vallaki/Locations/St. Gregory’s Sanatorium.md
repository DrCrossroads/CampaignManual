##### The Abandoned Hospital

- **Location**: Once a state-of-the-art mental health institution, St. Gregory‚Äôs was shut down after a series of increasingly violent and inexplicable incidents among the patients. The building is now a derelict ruin, its halls filled with the remnants of the patients‚Äô final, horrifying days.
- **Hauntings**: Patients who died in the institution have not found peace. Their tormented spirits wander the hallways, scratching at the walls or silently watching from dark corners. The air in the hospital feels suffocating, and the faint sounds of eerie laughter or muted screams can be heard echoing through the corridors. Occasionally, strange shadows move behind the old, rusted medical equipment.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: It‚Äôs rumored that some of the doctors experimented with "treatments" that went far beyond accepted practice. Among the abandoned files, one holds a secret that could explain the violent occurrences‚Äîa failed procedure that tore open a gateway to a realm of madness. Investigating might lead to uncovering a horrifying truth: the institution was a front for occult experiments disguised as medical practices.

## Nursery Rhyme
Count the steps and mind the doors,
The voices whisper through the floors.
A lullaby, a wailing tune,
A lullaby you‚Äôll learn too soon.

The beds are empty, so they say,
But voices talk both night and day.
They whisper, beg, they sob, they sigh,
They never left, they‚Äôll never die.

They never left, they never will,
They pace the halls, they wait, they kill.
Their murmurs seep through rotting stone,
Their sorrows carve you to the bone.
A door will creak, a shadow leans‚Äî
You‚Äôll wake to find it‚Äôs not a dream.

## Overview
A crumbling monument to forgotten suffering, **St. Gregory‚Äôs Sanatorium** stands at the edge of the city, shrouded in mist and decay. Once a **cutting-edge mental health facility**, it now lies in **ruin**, its walls riddled with **mold**, its corridors littered with **rusted gurneys and shattered glass**.

No one ventures here willingly. Locals whisper of **strange lights in the windows**, the sound of **wheels creaking down empty halls**, and the **echo of screams** from patients long dead.

## **Grounds & Exterior**

- The **front gates** are **chained shut**, the rusted sign barely legible beneath years of grime. The words **"St. Gregory's Sanatorium ‚Äì Hope Through Science"** can still be faintly read.
- The **courtyard** is **overgrown with dead ivy and tangled weeds**. An old **stone fountain** sits dry and cracked, its centerpiece‚Äîa statue of St. Gregory‚Äîmissing its head.
- The **building itself** is **three stories tall**, with **broken windows**, **collapsed roofing**, and **weathered walls** covered in strange, **scratched-out symbols**.

**Paranormal Occurrence:** A **faint, flickering light** moves through the windows of the upper floors, but no one is inside‚Ä¶ or so it seems.
