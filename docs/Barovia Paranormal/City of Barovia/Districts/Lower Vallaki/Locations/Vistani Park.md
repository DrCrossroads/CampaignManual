Several footpaths and horse trails lead to this location in the southwest of Lower Vallaki.

>The roads end at the edge of an expansive dirt-covered area with low houses built into around. Fog obscures the details, but you can see that these buildings feature elegantly carved woodwork and have decorative lanterns hanging from their sculpted eaves. In the center of the park is a small hill that stands above the fog and is home to a ring of barrel-topped vehicles that surround a large tent with a column of smoke pouring out through a hole in the top. The tent is brightly lit from within. Even at this distance, you can smell the odors of wine and horses that emanate from this central area.

This natural clearing serves as a permanent campsite for [[_The Vistani]].

###### ROLEPLAYING THE VISTANI
Use the following information to roleplay the Vistani that occupy the camp.
**Vistani**. The Vistani in this camp all serve Strahd who know him to be a vampire. The elders have died, leaving a pair of brothers named Luvash and Arrigal in charge. Both men are evil and willing to do whatever Strahd demands of them.
These Vistani have two problems. First, Luvash's seven-year-old daughter, Arabelle, recently disappeared from the camp. Consequently, half of the Vistani are out searching for her when the characters arrive. Second, the Vistani have exhausted their supply of wine and are eager to obtain more. Characters who help them with either problem earn the Vistani's respect.
