A **run-down, nearly abandoned station** where the city has **given up** enforcing the law. The officers here are **either corrupt, broken, or trying to survive**. The **locals call it "The Bonehouse"** because most cases **end in bodies, not justice**.

#### **Key Officers**
- **Captain Marla "Mad Dog" Carver (CN, Human)** – **A terrifyingly unpredictable leader** who **rages at incompetence but lets crime slide if it keeps order**. She tries to calm the populace by placing **"All will be well"** signs all over the precinct and in the district. She doesn't truly believe this mantra, but she will spout it in an attempt to calm the citizens.
- **Detective Ezra Calloway (CG, Tiefling)** – **One of the last honest cops**, Ezra **investigates missing people, serial killers, and supernatural cases** that others ignore.
- **Officer Benny Franks (NE, Human)** – **A dirty cop** who **sells weapons and info** to criminals, but **has an odd soft spot for kids**.
- **[[Izek Stranzi]]** - A dirty cop who is in [[_The Vallakovich Family]]'s pockets.

#### In the Cells
- [[Udo Rikalova]]

#### **Quest Hooks**
- **A serial killer is using the Bonehouse's old basement** as a hideout, and the officers are **too scared to go down there**.
- **A drug called "Eclipse" is spreading fast**, but it’s **not made by any gang**—it **changes people in unnatural ways**.
- **A child keeps showing up at the precinct, claiming their parents "aren't real anymore."** Ezra believes them.
