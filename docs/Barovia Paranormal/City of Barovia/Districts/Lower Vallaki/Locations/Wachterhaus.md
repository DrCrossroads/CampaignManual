_A house of whispers, where shadows stretch too far and secrets breathe beneath the floorboards._

#### **Overview**

The **Wachterhaus** is a **tall, narrow, three-story manor** with an **attic**, standing like a **monolith of faded elegance**. The exterior is **weathered stone**, its **gothic windows** staring down like judgmental eyes. Inside, the **house remains beautiful but oppressive**—the air is thick with **burnt incense, candle wax, and something deeper… something wrong**.

The **walls are adorned with paintings of the Wachter ancestors**, though **some faces seem blurred, twisted, or scratched away**. Candles **burn low**, and the shadows **flicker unnaturally**, moving even when the air is still.

**Supernatural Elements:**

- **Whispering Walls** – At night, the house **whispers secrets in Infernal**, voices rising and falling from within the walls.
- **Living Paintings** – The **portraits of Wachter ancestors shift subtly**; sometimes, **eyes blink or lips curl into knowing smirks**.
- **Fiona’s Mark** – A sigil burned into the **dining room table** pulses when touched, sending a **cold shiver down the spine**.
