>A large **garage yard** with several locked **work sheds** sits adjacent to a **sprawling vehicle repair warehouse**. A rusted sign above the front gate reads **"Arasek Auto & Repair."**
>Several **broken-down automobiles, motorbikes, and machinery parts** litter the parking lot, their metal frames covered in rust and oil stains. **Faint sounds of tools clinking and machinery groaning** echo from inside, though no workers can be seen at this late hour.
>At the **south end of the lot**, tucked between stacks of old tires and scrap metal, sits a **large, heavily reinforced transport truck**. Its **once-vibrant paint is chipped and peeling**, and **faded lettering** on its side reads:  
>	ðŸž® **"Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders"** ðŸž®
>A **heavy padlock** secures the truckâ€™s back doors, while **deep scratches and dried bloodstains** mark the metal siding.

## **Inside the Warehouse**

>The **warehouse interior** is a **mechanicâ€™s workshop** filled with **half-repaired cars**, **tool chests**, and **motorcycle parts** stacked in chaotic heaps. A thick layer of **grease and grime** covers the floor, making it **slick in places**.
>Overhead, a series of **dim electric lamps** flicker unreliably, casting long shadows between the stacked machinery. The air **reeks of oil, gasoline, and burnt rubber**.

#### **Gunther and Yelena Arasek**

## **Rictavio's Transport Truck**

[[Rudy von Richten#**Rictavio**|Rictavio]] (a cover identity for **Rudolph van Richten**) **paid the Araseks well** to store his **custom-modified transport truck**, **strictly forbidding** them from looking inside.

#### **Approaching the Truck**

_As the characters draw near, the truck suddenly **shudders**, as if something massive has slammed against the inside wall. A deep, inhuman **snarl** rumbles from within, followed by the ominous **creaking of metal** as the reinforced frame strains against its occupant._

A closer inspection reveals:

- **Deep claw marks** running along the metal siding.
- **Dry blood spatters** along the edges of the truck.
- An **inscription** above the door frame:  
    **"I bring you from Shadow into Light!"**

#### **Unlocking the Truck**

The truckâ€™s **back doors are padlocked** and rigged with a **poison needle trap** (see "Sample Traps" in the Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide).

- **Picking the lock**: DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)
- **Forcing it open**: DC 20 Strength

Inside, a **massive, caged beast** growls in the dim lightâ€”

#### **The Beast Inside**

ðŸ”¹ **A Sabretooth Tiger (AC 17, HP 84), wearing custom-fitted metal plating.**  
ðŸ”¹ It has been **trained to hunt supernatural creatures, including the Vistani**.  
ðŸ”¹ The tiger **recognizes the scent of evil** and reacts violently to it.

The **cage latch is secure**, but if opened, the tiger will:

- **Roam the streets, tracking down supernatural entities.**
- **Ignore most people**, but **attack Vistani on sight** unless stopped by Rictavio.
- **Return to Rictavio** (if found) or **disappear into the cityâ€™s underbelly**.

## **Plot Hooks & Secrets**

- **The Storage Sheds:** Some of the sheds contain **contraband**, **stolen auto parts**, or **occult artifacts** smuggled through the city. One shed might hide a **ritualistic murder scene** left by an unknown party.
- **Gunther & Yelenaâ€™s Paranoia:** The couple seems to **fear something**, always **locking their doors at night**. Are they hiding somethingâ€¦ or **hiding from something**?
- **The Tigerâ€™s Purpose:** If released, the tiger may uncover **hidden supernatural forces in the city**, leading the party to something darker lurking nearby.
