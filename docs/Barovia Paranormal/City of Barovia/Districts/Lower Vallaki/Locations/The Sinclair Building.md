##### The Abandoned Office Building

- **Location**: A once-thriving office building in the heart of the city, now eerily silent and boarded up. This was the headquarters of a now-defunct business empire that collapsed under mysterious circumstances in 1919. The building was left behind in haste, with papers and personal belongings still scattered on desks.
- **Hauntings**: The ghostly sounds of typewriters tapping, the soft rustle of papers turning, and voices murmuring in corners. Some employees claim they can still see figures in the windows of the upper floors, even though no one has entered for years. Rumors say the company's executives made a dangerous pact to secure their wealth, and their spirits are trapped, continuing their work even in death.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: A lost ledger found in the building reveals financial transactions linked to occult rituals. Investigating the site may reveal a dark conspiracy involving corporate greed, supernatural forces, and the disappearance of employees.
