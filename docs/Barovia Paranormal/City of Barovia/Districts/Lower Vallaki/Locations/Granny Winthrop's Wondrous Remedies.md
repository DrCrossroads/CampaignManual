_"Oh, donâ€™t mind the smell, dearie. The best cures always stink a little."_

An **elderly apothecary** who sells **potions, poisons, and folk remedies** out of a **cramped, candlelit shop** hidden in the slums. Her customers range from **desperate poor folk** to **hitmen looking for a quick kill**. Some say she was a **witch in another life**â€”or still is.

ðŸ”¹ **Description**
- A **frail, hunched old woman** with wild white hair and **sharp yellow eyes**.
- Wears **moth-eaten shawls** and always smells of **strange herbs and decay**.
- Her hands are **cold as ice**, and her fingers are **longer than they should be**.

ðŸ”¹ **How She Operates**
- No money? No problem. Granny Winthrop takes **"other forms of payment"**, including **secrets, memories, or years off your life**.
- If you break a deal, she **curses you**â€”and her curses always stick.
- Her shop is **larger on the inside**, filled with **hanging herbs, bottled horrors, and whispering jars**.

ðŸ”¹ **What She Sells**
- **Potions with unpredictable side effects**â€”strength potions that make you aggressive, healing potions that cause **disturbing dreams**.
- **Hexed objects**â€”charms that grant luck **at a cost**, cursed coins that **bring wealth but invite something to collect it**.
- **Poisons with supernatural properties**â€”some kill instantly, others make **the victim forget they were ever alive**.

ðŸ”¹ **Potential Hooks**
- Someone **bought a potion they shouldnâ€™t have**, and now **they are changing into something else**.
- A rival dealer **wants her out of the game**â€”but no one whoâ€™s tried has ever been seen again.
- She offers the party a **"free sample"**â€”but warns them: **"Everything comes due in the end, my dears."**
