>Gray smoke issues from the rear chimney of this large, two story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof, upon which several ravens have perched. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall and a neon sign in the window reads the hotel's name, "Blue Water Hotel."

#### NPCs
- [[Bray Martikov]]
- [[Brom Martikov]]
- [[Danika Dorakova]]
- [[Urwin Martikov]]

The Blue Water Inn is Vallaki's main gathering place for locals, especially at night. The innkeeper, Urwin Martikov, considers the inn a sanctuary from the evils of the city. In the event of trouble, the windows and doors can all be barred shut from within.
A bed for the night costs 5 sp. Characters looking for something to eat are fed hot beet soup and fresh bread at no additional charge. A cooked wolf steak costs 1 sp.
There is an entrance to [[The Feather]], hidden behind a bookshelf.

#### Events
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is hidden at the inn, [[_The Martikov Family]] doesn't reveal where the treasure is until they know the characters are capable of protecting it. As a way of testing their abilities, Urwin gives the characters the following quest:

>Urwin takes you aside and keeps his voice low. "My supply of liquor is nearly gone, and the next shipment is overdue. I'll give you what you seek if you bring me my liquor."

Urwin fails to mention that his cantankerous father, Davian Martikov, the don of the Martikov Family, owns the bootlegging business, the Wizard of Wines (chapter 12). There's bad blood between Urwin and his father (whom Urwin and Danika refer to as "the old crow"). Although Urwin could easily visit the warehouse himself, he considers dealing with his father to be a worthy test of the characters' competence, and he makes good on his promise if they complete the quest and return with his wine shipment.
Urwin sends a wereraven in raven form to observe the party's progress from a distance. If the characters get in trouble, the wereraven reports to Urwin at once.
