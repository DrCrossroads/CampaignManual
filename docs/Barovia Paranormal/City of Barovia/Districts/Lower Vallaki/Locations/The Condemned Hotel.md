Headquarters for [[Rudy von Richten]] and [[Ezmerelda (Ezi) D'Avenir]].

## _The Hunter’s Rest_
The Hunter’s Rest was once a glamorous hotel catering to the city’s elite, but it has long since fallen into disrepair. Van Richten has turned it into a fortress of paranoia, filled with traps, dead-ends, and fortifications designed to ward off supernatural threats. The entire hotel feels _wrong_, as if it's slightly out of sync with reality.

A neon sign blinks to the side of the door with Hunter's Rest written vertically. Several of the letters don't light.

### **First Floor Overview**

The party enters through the **main lobby**, but the hotel appears abandoned at first glance. The **elevator is out of order**, its doors rusted shut, and the **grand staircase has been destroyed**, forcing them to navigate the labyrinthine first floor to find another way up.

The entire hotel is _booby-trapped_, and each room contains some form of **mechanical, arcane, or psychological deterrent** against intruders.

#### **General Mechanics for First Floor**

- **Paranoia Check**: Every 30 minutes, have the party roll a **DC 13 Wisdom Save**. On a failure, they feel like they're being watched (hallucinations, shadows moving, whispers, etc.).
- **Noise Draws Attention**: If the party is loud, supernatural entities **manifest** and attack.
- **Traps Reset**: If they take too long, Van Richten’s security measures **reset**, forcing them to re-deal with obstacles.

#### **Rooms & Hazards on the First Floor**

###### **The Main Lobby**
- **Description**: A once-opulent space with a massive chandelier hanging above. The reception desk is empty, with a dust-covered guest book. A broken radio crackles to life with whispers of distorted voices.
- **Obstacles**:
    - **Trapped Chandelier**: The chandelier suddenly drops if anyone walks underneath it.
        - **Trigger**: Weight sensor in the floor.
        - **DC 15 Perception** to notice the cracks in the ceiling.
        - **DC 14 Dexterity Save** to avoid 3d6 bludgeoning damage.
    - **Supernatural Distortion**: The radio plays the voices of people who stayed in the hotel decades ago. Some may whisper cryptic clues. Others scream.

###### **The Hall of Mirrors**
- **Description**: A long hallway lined with **warped, dust-covered mirrors** that reflect unsettling images—sometimes showing the party as monsters, sometimes showing things that aren’t actually there.
- **Obstacles**:
    - **Phantom Reflections**: Some mirrors contain shadowy figures that _step out_ and attack.
        - **Encounter**: 2d4 _Mirror Shades_ (Specter-like entities).
    - **Distorted Paths**: The mirrors create an optical illusion where the hallway seems endless.
        - **DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)** to see through the trick.
        - If failed, the party loops back to the entrance.

###### **The Barricaded Dining Hall**
- **Description**: A once-grand dining area with overturned tables, boarded-up windows, and a heavy steel door at the far end. Van Richten has fortified this space as a last-resort holdout.
- **Obstacles**:
    - **Pressure Plate Trap**: A tripwire connected to a shotgun rigged to fire at chest height.
        - **DC 14 Perception** to spot the wire.
        - **DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)** to disarm.
        - Failure triggers the blast (4d6 piercing damage).
    - **Bloodstained Runes**: The walls have protective wards against supernatural entities. If any **undead** (including party members) enter, the symbols _ignite_, dealing **3d6 radiant damage** to all undead within 10 feet.

###### **The Hall of Chains**
- **Description**: Chains dangle from the ceiling, swaying despite the lack of wind. Some appear to be **restraining unseen entities**, while others move on their own.
- **Obstacles**:
    - **Possessed Chains**: Some lash out, attempting to entangle intruders.
        - **DC 16 Dexterity Save** or be **Restrained** by the chains (escape DC 14).
    - **Whispers in the Dark**: The chains rattle as ghostly voices whisper secrets, offering _forbidden knowledge_ in exchange for something the party holds dear.

###### **The False Staircase**
- **Description**: A grand staircase leads up… but **only in appearance**. The moment a character steps onto the stairs, they **collapse into a steep slide**, sending them into a **spiked barricade below**.
- **Obstacles**:
    - **Illusory Magic** hides the real nature of the stairs.
        - **DC 16 Investigation** to recognize it’s fake.
    - **Sliding Trap**: Anyone stepping on the stairs must make a **DC 15 Dexterity Save** or fall, taking **3d6 bludgeoning damage**.
    - **Finding the Real Path**: The true passage is hidden behind a **false wall** marked with arcane symbols.
        - **DC 15 Arcana or Perception** to find the passage.

###### **The Panic Room** (Van Richten's Trapped Vault)
- **Description**: A reinforced room filled with survival supplies, maps, and notes about supernatural threats. However, Van Richten has booby-trapped it to **prevent intruders**.
- **Obstacles**:
    - **Ward of Paralysis**: Entering without the proper incantation triggers a **paralysis spell**.
        - **DC 16 Wisdom Save** or be **paralyzed for 1 minute**.
    - **Spiked Cage Trap**: The floor collapses into a pit of **iron spikes** if an incorrect journal is moved.
        - **DC 15 Perception** to notice the trap.
        - **DC 14 Dexterity Save** to avoid falling (4d6 piercing damage).

#### **How to Reach the Next Floor**
- The elevator is **out of order**, but it has an emergency ladder **hidden behind a panel** (DC 14 Perception to find).
- A **hidden door** behind the false staircase leads to a **service stairwell**.
- A **dumbwaiter** in the Panic Room might fit a small character, leading to the second floor.

### **Second Floor Overview**
Unlike the maze-like first floor, the **second floor is a single long hallway** with numbered hotel rooms on either side. Dust-covered carpets line the floor, and flickering chandeliers cast **uneven, shifting light**. The air here feels _thicker_, as if something unseen is watching.

The party needs to cross the **entire hallway** to reach the other side, where they will find a **makeshift climbing point** leading to the third floor. However, Van Richten has **rigged this floor with new dangers**, and supernatural forces have **twisted the hotel itself**.

#### **General Atmosphere & Mechanics**
- **Paranoia Escalates**: Every 30 minutes, the party rolls a **DC 14 Wisdom Save** or experiences a hallucination—visions of past guests, flickering images of monstrous faces, or the sensation of hands brushing against them.
- **The Hallway Never Feels Empty**: Shadows move at the edge of their vision, and reflections in the dusty windows show things that _aren’t there_.
- **Unstable Reality**: The hallway _warps_ at times—doors stretch, the ceiling seems lower, or the walls appear to breathe.

#### **Traps & Encounters**

###### **The Sentient Statues (The Doormen)**
- **Location**: Flanking a large set of double doors halfway down the hallway.
- **Description**: Two **stone statues of bellhops** stand rigid on either side of the door. Their faces are **eerily lifelike**, their eyes following the party as they approach. The door beyond them is locked.
- **Trap Mechanics**:
    - The statues **remain still** until a player attempts to open the door.
    - The moment someone touches the handle, the statues **animate** and **block their path**.
    - **Skill Challenge to Pass:**
        - **Brute Force:** The statues have AC 17, 50 HP each, resistance to non-magical damage.
        - **Deception (DC 16):** Convince them that they are staff members.
        - **Offering a “Key” (DC 15 Investigation):** A missing **hotel key** (hidden in another room) convinces the statues to let them pass.
**Failing to pass peacefully results in combat:**
- The **Doormen** attack with **massive stone fists** (2d8+4 bludgeoning).
- Every **three rounds**, the statues begin **growing**, increasing their reach and damage.

###### **Room 209 – The Shifting Guest**
- **Location**: A locked room on the right side of the hallway.
- **Description**: The door is slightly ajar, and inside is a **perfectly preserved hotel room**. A mirror on the far wall **reflects something else**—a different room entirely.
- **Trap Mechanics**:
    - Entering the room triggers a **spatial distortion**.
    - The **player who enters first is separated from the rest of the party**, trapped in the _reflected_ version of the room.
    - **Escape requires:**
        - **DC 15 Insight or Arcana** to recognize the shift.
        - **Breaking the mirror** (shatters the trap but causes 2d6 psychic damage to the trapped character).
        - **Using a light source** to cast a perfect shadow (DC 15 Investigation).

###### **Room 217 – The Hungry Floor**
- **Location**: Near the far end of the hallway.
- **Description**: The floorboards outside this room creak strangely, as if **hollow**. A faint noise like **gnawing teeth** can be heard from beneath the carpet.
- **Trap Mechanics**:
    - Stepping on the wrong part of the floor triggers a **mimic-like floor trap**—the **boards split open**, revealing **a mass of biting mouths** underneath.
    - **DC 16 Dexterity Save** or take **3d8 piercing damage** and be **restrained** as the floor tries to drag them under.
    - **Solution:**
        - **Perception (DC 14)** to notice the floor’s strange breathing movement.
        - **Jumping over the trapped section** (Athletics DC 13).
        - **Casting fire or radiant damage onto the floor** makes it recoil for 1 round.

###### **The Phantom Bellboy**
- **Location**: Wandering the hallway.
- **Description**: A **ghostly bellboy** appears occasionally, pushing a luggage cart down the hall. He hums a warped, distorted tune. His uniform is tattered, and **his face is missing**.
- **Encounter Mechanics**:
    - If the party ignores him, he **disappears** after a few minutes.
    - If the party **speaks to him**, he turns and **opens his mouth—releasing a psychic scream**.
        - All creatures within 30 feet must make a **DC 15 Wisdom Save** or be **stunned for 1 minute** as their ears ring with the echoes of the past.
    - The **cart contains an old room key** (potentially useful for the Sentient Statues).

###### **The End of the Hall – The Climb to the Third Floor**
- **Obstacle**: The **staircase is destroyed**, but there is a **makeshift climbable structure** at the far end—Van Richten’s way of moving between floors.
- **Hazards**:
    - The walls **pulse like living flesh** as they climb.
    - Every **5 feet they climb**, roll a d6:
        - **1-3:** The climb is uneventful.
        - **4:** The wall _shifts_, forcing a **DC 13 Athletics check** or fall back down.
        - **5:** The lights go out for **6 seconds**, and something _moves_ near them.
        - **6:** A shadowy hand **grabs a player’s ankle**, forcing a **DC 15 Strength Save** or be **yanked downward into the dark**.

---

### **Third Floor Overview**
The third floor is **Van Richten’s true stronghold**, the most heavily fortified part of the hotel. The moment the party **climbs up from the second floor**, they feel an intense shift—the **air is colder**, the **lights dim**, and the **walls creak as if resisting their presence**. The smell of **gunpowder, incense, and old paper** lingers here.

Unlike the previous floors, this level **feels truly abandoned**—no signs of guests, no numbered doors. The **hallways are lined with boarded-up windows**, and arcane symbols **glow faintly** on the walls. The layout is **partially collapsed**, with some areas barricaded entirely.

The **sanctum lies at the far end**, but between the party and Van Richten are **his final defenses—both mechanical and arcane**.

#### **Trial 1: The Hall of Broken Time**
- **Obstacle**: The first hallway is **lined with old grandfather clocks**, each one **stopped at different times**. A faint ticking sound **echoes from nowhere**, but the clocks themselves **do not move**.
- **Trap Mechanics**:
    - **Stepping into the hallway causes time distortions**:
        - **Each player rolls 1d6** at the start of their turn:
            - **1-2:** They **speed up**, gaining an **extra action** this turn.
            - **3-4:** Nothing happens.
            - **5:** They **lose their turn**, trapped in a frozen moment.
            - **6:** They **relive their last action**, repeating their turn exactly.
    - **The only safe path**: A **correct sequence of stepping on the right floor tiles**, hidden within the times displayed on the clocks.
    - **Solution**:
        - **Investigation DC 16** to notice the time pattern.
        - **Arcana DC 14** to recognize the lingering magic.
        - **Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 15** to carefully move between safe spots.

#### **Trial 2: The Phantom Gunman**
- **Obstacle**: As the party nears the next door, they hear **the click of a revolver hammer being pulled back**—a **phantom gunslinger** stands at the end of the hall, a **shadowy figure in a trench coat**, his **face obscured by darkness**.
- **Encounter Mechanics**:
    - He **doesn’t speak**, but his **gun follows movement perfectly**.
    - If **anyone steps forward**, he fires a **ghostly bullet**, forcing a **DC 15 Dexterity Save** or take **4d8 force damage**.
    - **Ways to bypass him**:
        - **Insight DC 16**: Realize he only reacts to movement. Moving slowly (**Stealth DC 15**) bypasses him.
        - **Arcana DC 14**: Dispel his magic.
        - **Intimidation DC 16**: Call his bluff and stare him down.
        - **Using a mirror**: Reflect his own bullet back at him (Destroys the phantom).

#### **Trial 3: The Gauntlet of Wards**
- **Obstacle**: A final **stretch of hallway** is **covered in glowing runes**, connected by **silver wires and salt lines**—wards against the supernatural.
- **Trap Mechanics**:
    - The hallway is **rigged with multiple supernatural triggers**.
    - **Failing to avoid the traps** causes:
        - **Spectral chains to erupt from the walls**, forcing a **DC 14 Strength Save** or be restrained.
        - **A sudden, crushing gravity field** (DC 15 Constitution Save or be knocked prone).
        - **An illusory wall that loops them back to the start of the hallway** unless dispelled.
    - **Solution**:
        - **Perception DC 14** to spot the most dangerous sigils.
        - **Sleight of Hand DC 16** to disable the silver wires without triggering the ward.
        - **Arcana DC 18** to disrupt the entire field.

### **Van Richten’s Sanctum – The War Room**
After overcoming the final trials, the party **pushes open a reinforced steel door** and steps into **Van Richten’s Sanctum**—a room that feels **completely separate from the rest of the hotel**.

#### **Description of the Sanctum:**
- The **walls are covered in newspaper clippings, maps, and photographs** of supernatural creatures.
- A large **chalkboard** lists **sightings, patterns, and warnings** about various horrors across Barovia City.
- There is a map of Barovia City with photographs and newspaper clippings. Red string connects the maps and clippings created a web of connections.
- Shelves filled with **old tomes, ammunition boxes, old and yellowed books regarding vampires and Strahd and eldritch horrors, and vials of alchemical substances**.
- An **old radio crackles intermittently**, picking up distorted voices.
- The **entire floor is lined with salt**, and **silver bullets are scattered on the table**.

Van Richten himself is seated behind a **massive wooden desk**, cleaning a revolver. His **eyes are sharp but tired**, and as the party enters, he **smirks slightly**.

**"Took you long enough."**
