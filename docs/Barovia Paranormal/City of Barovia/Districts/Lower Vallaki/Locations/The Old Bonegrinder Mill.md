_“The wheel never stops turning. And neither do they.”_

## Nursery Rhyme
Turn and grind, the old wheel moans,
A voice within, a breath like stone.
Once it worked, now it waits,
For the witch's hand to seal your fate.

A decaying relic of an older Barovia City, **The Old Bonegrinder Mill** stands hunched along the riverbank, its **great wooden waterwheel churning ceaselessly** against the current. The structure is **tall and narrow, leaning slightly**, as if sagging under the weight of centuries of dark secrets. The roof shingles have curled like dead leaves, and its **thick wooden beams groan with every gust of wind**, as though whispering warnings to those who dare approach.

The mill was once a thriving grain-processing facility, but time and tragedy have **turned it into something far worse**. Most assume the mill was abandoned after a string of grisly disappearances, but in truth, **it never stopped operating.** Instead of grain, **the Coven of Morgantha** uses the mill to process _something else entirely_—bones, dreams, and despair—into their infamous **dream pastries.**

The air is thick with the scent of **mildew, rotting grain, and something sickly sweet**, barely masking an underlying _stench of decay._ Strange lights flicker in the attic windows at night, and the sounds of grinding never stop, even when **there should be nothing left to mill.**

## **LOCATIONS**

### **Outside the Mill** _(The Riverbank and Waterwheel)_

The shore here is **muddy and uneven**, slick with algae and half-sunken debris. **The river flows sluggishly**, as though reluctant to pass this cursed place. The great waterwheel looms against the current, **its paddles stained dark with age and something else.**

- **A broken wooden dock** juts into the river, missing planks like **rotted teeth.**
- **A rusted chain** dangles from the dock, disappearing into the water—something heavy is tethered below.
- At night, **faint wailing can be heard beneath the water**, as if the river itself is mourning.
- Anyone with sharp eyes might notice **small handprints in the mud**, leading toward the mill’s door—but not away.

---

### **Ground Floor** _(The Entry and Grinding Room)_

The entrance hall is **cluttered with old sacks of moldy grain**, stacked haphazardly to conceal **hidden pathways** deeper into the mill. **The grinding stone dominates the room**, still in operation despite **no visible source of grain.**

- **The millstones** turn **without pause**, grinding something **dry and brittle**—the **smell is disturbingly familiar.**
- **A ledger on a nearby table** lists past "deliveries"—but instead of grain amounts, the entries contain **names.**
- **An old iron oven** sits in the corner, still warm, with **a fresh batch of dream pastries cooling on a rack.**
- A faint **humming** can be heard upstairs, like a mother **singing to a child.**

---

### **The Bone Mill** _(Morgantha’s Lair)_

This dimly lit chamber contains **the true horrors of the mill.** The walls are **lined with shelves of labeled glass jars**, each one containing a **dark powder—ground bone**. The **floor is covered in a thin layer of pale dust**, kicked up by the churning of an **ancient iron contraption**—a perverse millstone **designed for flesh.**

- **Morgantha, the Coven Matriarch**, often lurks here, **meticulously inspecting her latest batch of "flour."**
- **A long wooden worktable** is splattered with something **too dark to be flour.**
- The **door to the room never quite closes all the way**—it’s as if the mill itself wants others to see inside.
- The room is **unnaturally cold**, and any flour spilled **swirls into shapes resembling screaming faces.**

---

### **The Bedroom** _(Sleeping Quarters of the Coven)_

A cramped, **dusty chamber filled with beds that look more like nests**, made from discarded rags, feathers, and **tufts of human hair.** The air is thick with the smell of **herbs, sweat, and something unclean.**

- **Three other witches/hags** sleep here, their **forms shifting between human and monstrous in candlelight.**
- **A wooden wardrobe in the corner** is filled with **children’s clothes**—but all **far too clean and new** for a place like this.
- **Scratched symbols on the bedposts** seem to **move when not directly looked at.**
- **A trapdoor in the floor** leads to a **deep crawlspace** filled with **scraps of paper**—each one containing a **forgotten prayer.**

---

### **The Doomed Attic** _(The Nightmare Chamber)_

The attic is the most **forbidden** part of the mill. The **roof sags inward**, and **holes in the walls let in the wind**, creating an eerie **howling sound** that never stops. This is where the Coven **stores the dreams they have stolen**, collecting them in **twisting glass orbs** that float **lazily through the air.**

- The orbs **pulse with dim light**, flickering as if **whispering secrets.**
- **A large, cracked mirror** dominates the room. It **does not reflect those who look into it**—instead, it shows **a different version of the viewer**, _one that never escaped._
- Anyone who stays here too long **begins hearing whispers**, pleading with them to **take one of the orbs and smash it.**
- If an orb is broken, **a haunting wail fills the room**, and **a spectral child drifts free**, sobbing before **vanishing into mist.**
