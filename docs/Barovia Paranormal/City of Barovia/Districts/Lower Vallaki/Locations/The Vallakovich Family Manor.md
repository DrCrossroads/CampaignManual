_A home of wealth and fear, where every shadow hides a secret and every hall is designed to trap the unwelcome._

#### **General Atmosphere**

The **Vallakovich Manor** is a **three-story mansion**, its **once-grand façade** marred by **reinforced doors, boarded-up windows, and hidden murder holes**. The **air is thick with cigar smoke**, and the **smell of gun oil and old blood** lingers beneath the perfume of **polished wood and expensive cologne**.

Inside, **rich crimson carpets** soften the sound of footsteps, while **massive chandeliers flicker with dim, golden light**. Yet, despite the luxury, there is an **overwhelming sense of paranoia**—the house itself feels like it’s **watching, waiting**.
