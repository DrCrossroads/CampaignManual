_A Grand Celebration of Divine Light, Hosted by The Church of the Eternal Light_

The **Radiance Revival Festival** is an annual public spectacle, orchestrated by The Church of the Eternal Light to reaffirm its grip on Barovia City. Held in Lower Vallaki, the festival serves as both a display of faith and a show of force. It takes place a short while after the characters arrive in the city, unless delayed or expedited based on their actions.

### **Event Description**

>The streets are alive with forced revelry. Church banners hang from streetlamps, their gold-threaded embroidery gleaming in the overcast sky. A **procession of orphans**, dressed in pristine white robes and clutching flickering candles, marches down the wet cobblestone streets. Their expressions are solemn, their voices raised in a hymn that echoes eerily through the district. Behind them, **priests and enforcers of the Church** carry a **massive gilded effigy of the sun**, constructed from twisted metal and salvaged industrial parts—an oppressive, heavy thing hoisted atop their shoulders.

At the festival’s peak, the effigy is placed atop a **raised pyre in front of the church building, [[Beacon of the Last Hope]]**, where High Priest Aldous Whitmore steps forth to deliver a **rousing sermon on purity, sin, and the cleansing light of the Eternal Flame.** He speaks of _"dark forces corrupting the city—debauchery, criminality, heresy"_—and how the city must **embrace the Light** to be saved.

The Church's enforcers begin **pouring barrels of contraband liquor** over the base of the effigy, a public display of their **war on sin and Prohibition enforcement**. The moment is meant to be triumphant, a divine act of purification—until the sky itself seems to **rebel**.

### **The Disruption**

>Dark clouds churn overhead. The moment Whitmore raises his torch to ignite the effigy, a **violent wind sweeps through the plaza**, extinguishing nearby lanterns and tossing hymn books into the air. The fire meant to symbolize the Light's triumph flickers **weakly**, struggling to take hold against the dampness in the air. The tension in the crowd is **palpable**, a silent question hanging over them: _Has the Light abandoned them?_
>And then, **a single sharp laugh cuts through the silence.**

The offender is **Detective Lars Kjurls**, a well-respected officer who’s known for his skepticism of the Church’s influence. The sound of his laughter rings like a gunshot in the uneasy quiet.

Church enforcers **immediately turn on him**, their expressions dark. "A blasphemer in our midst," one murmurs, stepping forward. The **Paladins of the Radiant Hand**, the Church’s elite enforcers, **close in**—their hands resting on **blackjack clubs and revolvers**, their faces grim.

Unless the characters intervene, **Lars is dragged away into a nearby alleyway**, where he will be **beaten into unconsciousness—or worse.**

### **Development**

- If the **characters intervene**, they **immediately draw the attention of the Church**.
- If they try to de-escalate the situation, **Whitmore himself** steps forward, using his booming voice to **shame and condemn** them.
- If they openly **challenge** the enforcers, **Whitmore gestures subtly**, and the Church’s enforcers attempt to **subdue them**—whether through intimidation, force, or arrest.
- If the characters **do nothing**, Lars is beaten within an inch of his life and **thrown into the sewers**, where he will later **resurface with vital information about the Church’s hidden dealings**—if he survives.

Either way, **the city takes note**. The Church of the Eternal Light does not forget those who disrupt its message.

### **Additional Twists & Hooks**

- **Dark Omens:** Some attendees claim to have seen **shadowy figures** moving unnaturally in the smoke as the effigy burned. What did they see? Was it a trick of the fire, or something more eldritch?
- **An Unlit Torch:** A **high-ranking Church official** pulls the characters aside afterward. They confess that **the Eternal Light may be faltering**—but admitting such heresy would mean execution. Do they dare investigate?
- **A Mysterious Stranger:** After the event, the characters are **approached by a hooded figure**, whispering: _"The Light blinds you. The real enemy lurks beneath. Meet me at the docks at midnight."_
