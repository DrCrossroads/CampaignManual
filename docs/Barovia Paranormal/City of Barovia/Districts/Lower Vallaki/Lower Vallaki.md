### _(The River Slums, The Merchant’s Divide)_

Split in two by the wide, black waters of the **Luna River**, Lower Vallaki is a city within a city—its two halves **connected by stone bridges** that always seem one storm away from collapse. The northern half is home to bustling markets and decayed merchant districts, while the **southern half sinks into filth and ruin**, a haven for slum-dwellers, gangsters, and outlaws.

The people of Lower Vallaki are **hardened survivors**, navigating **filthy alleyways, collapsed buildings, and wooden tenements** that sag under their own weight. **The city's criminal underworld thrives here**, weaving in and out of the docks, gambling dens, and speakeasies.

- **Notable Locations:**
    - **The Bridge Market** – A marketplace set **directly atop one of the bridges**, its merchants bartering in stolen goods, bootleg liquor, and questionable relics.
    - **The Black Veil** – A secret speakeasy hidden beneath a crumbling church, where politicians and gangsters alike drink **in whispered company**.
    - **The Sunken Alley** – A series of ruined streets that have **collapsed into the river**, forming a dangerous, half-flooded labyrinth beneath the city.
- **Atmosphere:**
    - The river **never seems clean**, its waters reflecting **only darkness**.
    - **Music, laughter, and distant gunshots** echo through the slums at night.
    - The streets are alive with **desperate merchants, pickpockets, and enforcers shaking down businesses** for protection money.

	- A melody soft, a voice so sweet,
	  It calls you in, it binds your feet.
	  One verse, you see what shouldn’t be,
	  Two verses, time begins to bleed.
	  Three verses—oh, too late to run,
	  Her song is sung, her work is done.
	  
	  She sings so sweet, a lullaby,
	  She hums until your mind runs dry.
	  Close your ears or go insane,
	  Once you’ve heard, you’ll know her name.
	  
	  She hums, she sways, she sings so sweet,
	  A tune that pulls you off your feet.
	  Close your eyes and drift away,
	  To wake no more at the light of day.
