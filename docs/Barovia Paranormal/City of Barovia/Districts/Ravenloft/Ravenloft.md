## Descriptions
### _(The City’s Throne, The Shadow of Power)_

Perched high above the city, **Ravenloft** is the district of the elite—home to powerful politicians, church leaders, and the wealthy who seek _true_ control. Gothic architecture dominates the skyline, with towering structures built to inspire awe and fear. The people here _act_ as if nothing is amiss in Barovia City, dismissing horrors as **"lower-class superstition."** However, every resident here has a secret, and those who pry too deeply often **vanish into the fog.**

**Notable Features:**
- **The Clocktower of the Eternal Dawn:** The Church of the Eternal Light’s **largest cathedral**, with a bell that tolls _not for the hour, but for the dead._
- **The House of Veils:** A luxury brothel where the masked clientele are rumored to be _more than human._
- **The Grand Court of Barovia:** Where justice is handed down—though only those with _wealth or power_ can expect a fair trial.

**Atmosphere:**
- The streets are pristine, but **eerily lifeless** at night. Even the gaslights seem to burn dimmer here.
- **Everyone watches.** Windows are rarely truly dark, and figures can be seen behind curtains, even when no one should be home.
- A **pervasive, unshakable feeling of being judged.** As if the district itself disapproves of your presence.
