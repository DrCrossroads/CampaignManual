- **Location**: Nestled in a quiet, forgotten part of the city, the bathhouse once catered to the wealthy elite who sought relaxation and privacy. Now, the once-lavish interior is faded and worn. The marble tiles are cracked, and the water in the pools no longer sparkles with the same luxurious clarity. The faint scent of dampness and mildew pervades the air. Though it is still technically open, it’s largely deserted, with only a few patrons coming and going, their experiences often strange and unsettling.
- **Hauntings**: The bathhouse has a long history tied to excess and decadence. Rumors abound of secret meetings held in the steam rooms and private baths, where powerful men made deals that would haunt the city’s future. But something dark was born from those whispered agreements. At night, the bathhouse seems to come alive with unseen activity. The sound of water sloshing, distant voices echoing, and a sudden chill that fills the air are common occurrences. People who use the baths often report feeling an unnerving sensation of being watched, and sometimes, a faint figure in a wet, flowing gown can be seen moving near the pools—though no one ever remembers seeing her enter.
- **Paranormal Phenomena**:
    - **Misty Shadows**: The steam rooms, once a place for relaxation, now feel suffocating and oppressive. Those who linger too long feel cold, their skin prickling as though they’ve been touched by icy hands. Occasionally, figures emerge from the steam, moving just out of sight, whispering words in a language no one recognizes.
    - **The Lurking Woman**: The most disturbing presence in the bathhouse is that of a woman in a white, flowing gown who appears in the mirrors just as a patron finishes bathing. She is always seen from the corner of the eye, a fleeting image in the glass, with an unsettling smile. Some claim that if she’s seen directly, she vanishes into the mist, leaving only the faintest smell of lavender and roses.
    - **The Pools of Memory**: The water in the baths is unnaturally still, and some say that the pools have the power to reveal the viewer’s deepest secrets or darkest desires. Those who dare to look into the water often see distorted reflections, or they catch glimpses of moments from their past—some pleasant, others deeply traumatic. The longer one gazes, the harder it becomes to look away.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The bathhouse was once owned by a wealthy aristocrat who made a pact with an ancient spirit to ensure eternal beauty and youth. In exchange, she agreed to provide sacrifices from those who bathed in the waters—especially the women who sought solace there. The ghostly woman is her restless spirit, and her appearance is a warning to those who are drawn into the house’s power. The bathhouse is cursed, with the souls of the sacrificed women trapped in the steam, longing for release. To break the curse, the players must uncover the secrets of the woman’s pact and decide whether to fulfill or destroy it.

## Nursery Rhyme
Mirror clear, water bright,
Touch the glass, step from sight.
Beauty fades, the past still calls,
One by one, the lost ones fall.

Steam still rises, soft and white,
A woman's voice hums in the night.
She bathed in youth, she bathed in light,
Yet others drowned to keep her bright.
Step in, step deep, feel warm embrace—
And watch your years just melt away.

A beauty fair, a mirror wide,
A face once young now cracks with pride.
A price was paid, a soul was sold,
Now the water runs so cold.

## Overview
**Location Description:** Tucked away in a forgotten corner of the city, the Forsaken Baths were once a retreat for the wealthy elite. Now, the grandeur has faded—cracked marble tiles line the floors, and the once-ornate columns are chipped and worn. The main pools sit beneath high, domed ceilings where faded frescoes of sea nymphs and water deities watch from above, their painted eyes dull with time. The air is thick with the scent of damp stone, mildew, and something more unsettling—like perfumed decay.

A pervasive silence hangs over the establishment, broken only by the occasional drip of water from unseen leaks. Despite still being in operation, few dare to visit, and those who do report strange occurrences. The deeper one wanders into the baths, the more the temperature fluctuates—one moment unbearably hot, the next bone-chillingly cold.

## **Notable Areas:**

### 1. **The Grand Pool**
- A vast, still body of water reflecting the ceiling’s faded murals. The reflections often distort into grotesque shapes when no one is looking. Some claim to hear voices calling their names from beneath the water’s surface.
  - A marble statue of a woman in flowing robes stands at the pool’s edge, water perpetually trickling from her hands. At times, her head appears to be turned in a different direction than before.

### 2. **The Steam Rooms**
- Once a place of relaxation, the steam rooms now feel oppressive. The mist clings unnaturally, forming shifting shapes in the air.
- Those who stay too long report feeling ghostly hands brush against their skin, accompanied by whispers in an unknown tongue.
- Some claim to see figures moving in the mist—tall, gaunt shadows that vanish when approached.

### 3. **The Mirror Hall**
- A long corridor lined with tall, tarnished mirrors. These mirrors do not always show proper reflections—sometimes they display past visitors, and sometimes they show nothing at all.
- The most feared apparition, **The Lurking Woman**, is most often seen here, watching from just beyond the glass.

### 4. **The Private Baths**
- These secluded bathing chambers were once a luxury for the elite, but now they seem to hold their own secrets. Some doors lock on their own, and bathers report seeing glimpses of another bather in their room—only for the figure to dissolve into the water.
- Water sometimes ripples as if someone is stepping into the bath, though no one is there.

### 5. **The Owner’s Chamber**
- A hidden chamber deep within the bathhouse, where the original owner performed rituals to maintain her youth and beauty. The room contains old, crumbling journals detailing her dark pact.
- A dried-up bath sits at the center, the water long gone but the tub still damp, as if something unseen lingers there.

## **Paranormal Encounters:**

1. **Misty Shadows**
    - In the steam rooms, figures move just out of sight, whispering words that linger in the mind long after they fade. Staying too long causes intense hallucinations.

2. **The Lurking Woman**

    - A ghostly woman in a wet, white gown appears in the mirrors, just out of direct sight. She vanishes if looked at directly, leaving only the scent of lavender and decay.
    - If ignored for too long, she may whisper directly into a visitor’s ear, her voice cold and wet.

3. **The Pools of Memory**
    - Those who gaze into the water too long see disturbing visions—sometimes of their own past, sometimes of the past sacrifices made in the bathhouse.
    - In some cases, the water becomes thick and black, and hands reach from below, trying to pull onlookers in.

4. **Echoes of the Past**
    - Late at night, the bathhouse plays out scenes from its past—whispered conversations, shadowy figures reenacting secret dealings, and the final moments of those who vanished within its walls.

**Paranormal Investigation Mechanics:**

- **Temperature Shifts:** Using temperature-sensing equipment reveals unnatural fluctuations, particularly near the pools and in the steam rooms.
- **Water Residue:** Footprints of wet steps appear in impossible places, sometimes leading investigators toward—or away from—certain areas.
- **Mirror Phenomena:** Investigators using cameras or scrying tools in the Mirror Hall may see reflections of things not present in the room.
- **EVP Recordings:** Electronic Voice Phenomena capture whispered phrases that cannot be heard with the naked ear, often in an unknown language.
- **Symbolic Traces:** Runes, names, or arcane symbols appear on fogged-up glass or mirrors, revealing pieces of the bathhouse’s dark history.

**Possible Plot Hook:** The bathhouse’s original owner made a pact with an ancient spirit, sacrificing the souls of young women who bathed in its waters to retain her beauty and power. Now, the ghosts of the sacrificed haunt the pools, and the spirit that granted the pact demands new victims. The Lurking Woman was the last intended sacrifice, but something went wrong, and her spirit now lingers as a warning—or a trap.
