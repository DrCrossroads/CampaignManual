## **A Skyscraper of Shadows**

A **monolithic structure of black stone and gleaming brass**, The Lofts looms over the city like a sentinel of despair. The building is alive with a faint hum, as if whispering in a voice too low to hear. **Gargoyles and strange winged figures** decorate the façade, their forms shifting in the flickering gaslights. The inside is a maze of luxury and decay—velvet carpets over rotting wood, brass chandeliers dripping black ichor, and halls lined with paintings whose eyes seem to follow visitors.

#### **DM Notes**
- The Lofts should feel like a **blend of a corporate empire and an eldritch nightmare**, where reality bends at Strahd’s will.
- Some **floors may not obey physics**, shifting unexpectedly.
- The **combat with Strahd could involve phasing between different floors** as he moves through his domain.

#### **d20 Random Encounter Table – The Lofts**
1. **A shadowy figure** whispers secrets about the building’s past, only to **vanish the moment a player gets too close.** The words linger in their mind, a riddle or warning.
2. **A janitor**, mopping up a **dark red stain**, insists it’s “just wine.” As they turn, **their mop writhes and drips with something alive**, whispering in a language that hurts to hear.
3. A **telephone rings** from a nearby office. If answered, a deep voice breathes, **“They’re watching you.”** The line **goes dead**, but the **receiver is now slick with something cold.**
4. **A flickering hallway light** reveals **something standing in the shadows** at the end of the hall. It never moves—but every time the lights flicker, **it gets closer.**
5. **An old elevator opens unexpectedly.** Inside, a lone man in a 1920s business suit **stares blankly ahead**. If spoken to, he turns slowly and whispers, **"Wrong floor."** The doors shut. He is never seen again.
6. **A room where time moves differently.** Hours pass in seconds, or players see **ghostly echoes of past events—murders, deals, betrayals—all happening at once.**
7. **A typewriter clicks away at an empty desk, typing out the players’ names.** The moment they notice, the keys stop, and the paper burns to ash.
8. **A vending machine flickers and changes.** All items are now labeled **in an unknown script**, and some seem to **move inside their packaging.** Pressing a button **dispenses something rotten but still breathing.**
9. **A mirror shows distorted reflections.** If a player watches too long, their **reflection smirks at them and walks away on its own.**
10. **A stack of files in an abandoned office bears one player’s name.** Inside are detailed reports of **their past, present… and future.** Some entries have yet to happen.
11. **A locked office door swings open on its own.** Inside, a **radio plays distorted jazz**, but when players enter, it **stops mid-note.** The room is **filled with dusty chairs facing a single spotlight.**
12. **A briefcase sits unattended.** Inside is a **severed hand, still gripping a pen.** The pen scratches out a contract on its own, and the ink is **thick and red.**
13. **A file cabinet drawer bursts open, scattering papers.** The top file contains a **detailed report of the players’ current mission—written as if it has already happened.**
14. **The hallway stretches longer than before.** The more the players walk, the further their destination **seems to get.** The only way out is **to walk backward.**
15. **A woman in a secretary’s outfit rushes by, muttering about a meeting she’s late for.** She steps into a conference room and vanishes. The room is **empty and covered in dust.**
16. **A security guard stares at an empty screen, nodding slowly.** When approached, he turns and asks, **"Do you think they’ll let us out?"** before fading into mist.
17. **A single, loud knock echoes through the floor.** The sound **reverberates**, as if someone **or something massive** is knocking on the very walls of reality.
18. **An emergency exit sign flickers, displaying unreadable symbols.** When players look away and back again, it **now points to a door that wasn’t there before.**
19. **A lost employee asks for help finding his office.** If followed, he leads them in **endless circles** before stopping and whispering, **“Oh… I don’t work here anymore.”** He crumbles into dust.
20. **A newspaper on a desk updates itself in real-time, printing headlines about the players' current actions.** The final line always reads: **"They will not survive the next floor."**

##### Witch
>[!NOTE]- Description
>You hear a woman's scratchy voice calling out a name.
>"Grizzlegut! Grizzlegut, where are you? A pox on you, you mangy cat!"
>Through the darkness comes a crone wearing a wide brimmed black hat and wearing a soot stained dress.

Players can try and hide from the witch (who has dark-vision) or catch her by surprise. The witch is one of the servants of Strahd dwelling in the area. She is calling out the name of her black cat familiar, which has gone missing. If the characters confront her, the old bat spits at the and begins casting a spell.
This encounter happens only once. If this result happens again, treat it as no encounter.

##### Black Cat
>[!NOTE]- Description
>The darkness lets out a demonic hiss as a black cat darts out of the shadows trying its best to avoid you.

This familiar is searching for its mistress, the Witch. It wants nothing to do with the players but attacks if cornered.
If the players capture or kill the cat, this encounter doesn't occur again and anytime this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.

## **Key Floors & Features**
Each floor contains unique locations filled with horror, intrigue, and eldritch influence.

### **B1 - The Laboratory of the Damned**
A massive, dimly lit facility hidden beneath the skyscraper, filled with arcane machinery and eldritch experiments. The walls hum with energy, and the air smells of **ozone, formaldehyde, and something disturbingly organic**.

#### **Encounters**
- **The Eldritch Surgeon:** A spectral doctor **moves from room to room**, performing **ritualistic procedures** on invisible patients. If disturbed, he may **attempt to “fix” one of the players.**
- **Escaped Experiment:** An experiment **lurks within the vents and walls**, watching the players. It may **ambush them in a tight corridor** or **slowly stalk them throughout the floor.**

##### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **The Observation Chamber**
- **A massive two-way mirror** looks into **The Surgical Theater** where **something humanoid still moves, but its shape is indistinct.**
- **If the players enter the cell, the mirror distorts and shows their reflections shifting into monstrous versions of themselves.**
- **Interacting with the controls reveals distorted logs of past experiments—testing the limits of the human mind.**
###### **The Surgical Theater**
- An **operating table made of obsidian**, restraints still warm to the touch.
- **Vials of dark ichor**, labeled with cryptic names, some labeled with past failed experiments.
- **A journal of Strahd’s chief scientist**, detailing attempts to merge eldritch energy with living hosts.
- **The Bleeding Walls:** In certain areas, **walls ooze black ichor**, shifting unnaturally when unobserved.
- **Encounter:** A failed experiment—a **twisted amalgamation of human and shadow**, writhing as it senses fresh prey.
###### **Containment Chambers**
- Rows of **massive glass tubes** filled with humanoid figures suspended in viscous green fluid. Some are alive.
- **A control panel with flickering switches**—flipping the wrong one might **release one or more test subjects**.
- **One chamber holds something ancient and alive**—a pulsating heart-like mass that beats in sync with the players' own.
- One chamber holds [[Emil Toranescu]] who has been tortured since his capture and doesn't trust anyone.
###### **The Testing Lab**
- **Scorch marks, bloodstains, and shattered machinery litter the floor.**
- **This lab once tested paranormal abilities**—subjects were **pushed to their limits, some torn apart in the process.**
- **A broken radio occasionally crackles to life, playing distorted screams and static-laden conversations from decades past.**
- **A chalkboard contains mathematical equations that seem to change when no one is looking.**
###### **The Reality Distortion Wing**
- A hallway where **gravity shifts**, pulling players toward the ceiling, then the walls, creating a **maddening, shifting battle map**.
- **A void mirror**—staring into it shows glimpses of oneself… **but in another world, doing something different**.
- **An unsealed door leads to B2**, but going through it makes time flicker—**the players momentarily see themselves die, then return to normal.**
###### **The Isolation Wing**
- **A dark hallway with heavy steel doors, each with a viewing slit.**
- **Muffled noises** emanate from some rooms—some sound human, others… less so.
- **If a player looks through a slit, they may see**:
    - **A humanoid shape with too many eyes staring back.**
    - **An empty room… but their own reflection staring at them from the wrong side.**
    - **A patient strapped to a bed, whispering a warning the players can’t quite hear.**
- **One door has been forced open**, leading to a room **covered in claw marks and eldritch script.** Something **escaped, but where is it now?**
###### **The Failed Prototypes Vault**
- Rows of steel cells, their locks **twisting into alien shapes**, keeping **horrors imprisoned but not dormant**.
- **Encounter:** Several Abyssal Stalkers have broken free, skittering through vents and attacking from above.
###### **Strahd’s Private Experimentation Chamber**
- A **darkened office filled with notes**—Strahd’s research on how the Elder God gifted him immortality.
- A **large dragon's skull** is mounted behind the desk. - This skull belongs to [[Argynvost]] and should be taken to [[The Silver Mausoleum]] to complete the quest for [[Godfrey Gwilym]] and heal [[Vladimir Horngaard]].
- **A single sheet of paper in the center** with a sentence written in **someone else’s handwriting**:
    - _“You are only a fragment of what was meant to be.”_
- **A homunculus in a cage**, whispering in a language no one understands… yet it still makes sense.
###### **The Cryo-Chamber**
- **Freezing mist seeps from an open door.** Inside, rows of **frost-covered stasis pods line the room.**
- **Some pods are shattered, others still contain… something.**
- If a player touches the control panel, **they hear a distant voice whisper, “Do you wish to awaken them?”**
- **A single pod is locked with heavy chains, with scratches on the inside of the glass.**

---

### **B2 - The Crypt of the Forgotten**
A vast, subterranean necropolis that extends **far deeper than it should**, lined with ancient sarcophagi and walls covered in **alien glyphs that glow faintly when touched**. Unlike Castle Ravenloft’s gothic crypts, this is **something older, something alive**.

##### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **The Chamber of the Unnamed**
- A **spiral descent into blackness**, where **hundreds of nameless graves** rest under the floor.
- If the party **steps into the wrong spot**, hands claw out of the stone, grasping at their ankles.
###### **The Cathedral of Hollow Prayers**
- A massive underground chamber resembling a **church built in reverse**, with **pews on the ceiling** and **stained-glass windows showing impossible constellations**.
- **The pulpit is empty… but a voice echoes as if someone is speaking from it.**
- **Encounter:** The Last Gatekeeper, standing motionless before the altar, waiting to judge the party.
###### **The Sarcophagus of False Kings**
- A **long, shadowed corridor lined with coffins**, each engraved with the names of **past rulers of Barovia who never existed**.
- Some **whisper** when the players pass by, **offering knowledge, deals, or warnings**.
- There is **armor on a sarcophagus with a sword through it**. If the sword is pulled free, the players will free [[Klutz Tripalotsky]].
###### **The Well of the Forgotten Oaths**
- A **gaping abyss at the center of the crypt**, its **water an impossible shade of black**.
- **Drinking from it allows a player to glimpse the past**—but doing so also **invites something to glimpse them back**.
###### **Strahd’s True Resting Place** _(Boss Battle Arena?)_
- A **simple stone slab**, marked only with a **shattered nameplate**.
- **Above it, the ceiling is a mural of the stars**—but they are shifting, almost… watching.
- **When the players approach, the shadows around them ripple, and something moves beneath the slab.**
****

###### **Extra Mechanics & Atmosphere**
- **Lights flicker irregularly**, as if something is breathing through the electrical currents.
- **Some rooms are upside down**, forcing the players to navigate in ways that defy physics.
- **The deeper they go, the colder the air becomes**—but only **their breath, not their bodies, reacts to the temperature.**
- **The entire crypt is slightly… wrong.** Walls stretch when not looking, and the doorways seem just a little too tall.

---

### **1st Floor**
The first floor of The Lofts exudes a sense of power, wealth, and authority—but beneath its **elegant Art Deco aesthetic, something is deeply wrong**. The marble floors reflect more than just light. The golden fixtures seem to pulse, almost alive. The employees and visitors move **just a bit too smoothly**, their faces **a little too perfect, too symmetrical**. Something is watching. **Something is listening.**

##### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **The Lobby** (Central Hub)
- **A grand, lavish art deco lobby** with massive pillars and a black-and-gold color scheme.
- A **sprawling, high-ceilinged lobby** with gold-trimmed pillars and a massive **black obsidian chandelier** resembling an inverted tree.
- The **floor is polished marble**, but sometimes, when the players look down, their reflections **lag behind** their movements.
- The **reception desk is manned by an unnervingly still attendant**, their eyes unblinking. They may not be human.
- **Lurking Presence:** A shadow moves in the corners of the room, but there is **no source of light** casting it
- The elevator doors are lined with arcane sigils, shifting when viewed from the corner of the eye.
- **A jazz band plays softly in the corner**, but upon closer inspection, they aren’t breathing.
###### **The Hall of Echoes (Elevator Hall)**
- A long hallway lined with **massive brass elevator doors**, each marked with an **ever-changing symbol**.
- **The buttons don’t always work as expected.** Pressing the same one twice might take the party somewhere else entirely.
- **Whispering Hallway:** The players hear **distorted echoes** of their own conversations, but the words have changed slightly.
- **Hidden Threat:** One of the elevators is a **mimic**, its doors splitting apart into an enormous maw.
###### **The Waiting Room of the Forgotten**
- Rows of **plush leather chairs** and a **roaring fireplace** create a warm, inviting space—but the **portraits on the wall depict no one.**
- **A bell rings**, signaling that someone is ready to be seen… but there’s **no receptionist**.
- **Unsettling Detail:** A stack of **newspapers on the table** all carry **tomorrow’s date** and headlines about the party’s upcoming choices.
###### **The Security Checkpoint**
- A row of **glass security gates**, manned by **two guards in immaculate suits**—but they **never blink**.
- A **small device on the counter hums with arcane energy**, scanning visitors **not for weapons, but for knowledge of the Elder God**.
- **If a player fails the scan**, an alarm goes off—but instead of sirens, the players hear **laughter, far away yet deafening**.
###### **The Vaulted Couriers' Hall**
- A back room filled with **rows of locked mailboxes**, each marked with **a number too long to be real**.
- Some mailboxes open **on their own**, revealing **letters written in the players’ own handwriting, but dated from years ago or years ahead**.
- **A single package sits unclaimed**, humming with eldritch power. Inside is **a mask shaped exactly like one of the players’ faces**.
###### **The Concierge’s Office**
- A richly furnished office with **floor-to-ceiling bookshelves**, **cigarette smoke curling in the air**, and a **mahogany desk covered in untouched paperwork**.
- **The Concierge is here**, but his eyes are **solid black**. He speaks with **perfect, rehearsed politeness**, yet **never acknowledges questions about the building’s true nature**.
- If questioned too much, **his skin begins to crack**, revealing **twitching tendrils beneath**.
###### **The Grand Ballroom (Event Space)**
- A massive open room with **black and gold Art Deco decor**, crystal chandeliers, and a **stage with an old microphone**.
- The room is **completely empty**, yet the **air vibrates as if music is still playing**.
- **Phantom Dancers:** If the party stands still for too long, figures begin to **fade into existence**, waltzing through them, whispering forgotten secrets.
###### **The Ballroom of Lost Whispers
- A **massive, abandoned ballroom**, haunted by the echoes of past revelers.
- When music plays, **ghostly figures appear, dancing as if unaware of the intruders**.
- An enchanted mirror shows **distorted, monstrous reflections of the party**.
###### **The Hidden Foyer** (Secret Room Behind a Wall Panel)
- A **false wall** in the lobby leads to a **hidden chamber** lined with **occult books and surveillance screens** showing **rooms the players haven’t been to yet**.
- **One screen shows the players from behind**—but when they turn, there’s nothing there.
- **A small, dusty phonograph is here**, constantly turning, though the record is blank. If played, it plays **the players' own voices, speaking of events they have not yet lived.**

##### **Atmospheric Mechanics & Effects**
- **Lights flicker inconsistently**, but never in a predictable pattern.
- **Sometimes, the furniture seems different** when a player looks away.
- **There is always someone standing just outside the party’s peripheral vision.**
- **No matter how long they stay, the clocks in the lobby never move.**

---

### **2nd Floor**
The second floor of The Lofts is an elite space, reserved for the city's most powerful figures—tycoons, politicians, crime lords, and occultists who whisper in dark corners. Yet, beneath the luxurious veneer, **this place is wrong**. **Everything feels too pristine, too symmetrical—like a dream that has started to rot.** Conversations in one room might echo in another. When no one is looking, **the furniture seems to rearrange itself.**

##### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **The Grand Lounge**
- A **speakeasy hidden behind a fake wall**, where criminals and corrupt officials drink alongside otherworldly figures.
- - A massive lounge with **plush leather seating**, **dim golden lighting**, and a **self-playing piano** that never quite gets the melody right.
- A **player piano plays on its own**, but when the melody changes, time seems to loop for a few seconds.
- [[Ezmerelda (Ezi) D'Avenir]] sings at the microphone, looking pale and ghostly.
- **Guests (Illusions? Spirits?) sip from glasses of wine, but never actually drink.** If the party gets too close, **the figures vanish.**
- A **grand window offers a view of the city skyline**, but sometimes, after blinking, **the buildings seem different.**
- **A hidden ledger details Strahd’s business dealings**, revealing connections to the Church and other factions.
###### **The Cigar Room (The Smoking Chamber of Secrets)**
- A low-lit room with **velvet armchairs and brass ashtrays**, filled with a thick haze of smoke.
- **A humidor filled with cigars**, but each is labeled with a **name.** If a player smokes one, **they experience a vivid vision of that person’s death.**
- **The Portraits Whisper**: Lining the walls are paintings of the city’s most influential figures—but if a player **steps too close**, the figures in the paintings **lean forward and whisper secrets.**
###### **The Black Mirror Lounge**
- A room lined with **immaculate, floor-to-ceiling black mirrors**, which do not always reflect the players correctly.
- Sometimes, **the reflections keep moving even after the players have stopped.**
- **A single chair sits in the center of the room**, facing a mirror that does not show the player’s reflection at all—but instead **something else looking back.**
###### **The Gallery of Faces**
- **A private art collection**, filled with **bizarre, moving portraits**. Some of the paintings **depict the players—but older, changed, or twisted into something inhuman.**
- One painting **looks exactly like the current room—but includes an extra figure standing behind the party.**
- **A locked display case** in the center contains a **golden mask**, inscribed with **a name the party doesn’t recognize, but feels strangely familiar.**
###### **The Tapestry Room (Living Threads)**
- A luxurious **reading room**, its walls covered in **massive, woven tapestries depicting moments of history—some of which haven’t happened yet.**
- **The fabric shifts when no one is looking.** If touched, the threads feel **warm, like flesh.**
- **If a player tears a thread**, they experience a **brief but vivid memory that isn’t their own.**
###### **The Velvet Lounge (The Empty Party)**
- A **private club space** with a **grand circular bar**, though the bottles behind it **are all unlabeled**.
- The **ghostly sound of a jazz band** plays from nowhere. The stage is **empty, but the microphone sways, as if someone is singing.**
- If a player orders a drink, the bartender (who wasn’t there before) **stares at them without blinking, then pours something dark and shifting.** If consumed, **it restores health, but the drinker sees an unknown figure watching them from across the room.**
###### **The Whispering Hallway (Eldritch Networking)**
- A hallway **lined with private meeting rooms**, doors left slightly ajar, revealing **shadowy figures in heated discussions.**
- As the party passes, the voices **change to ones they recognize—people they know, speaking secrets they were never meant to hear.**
- If a player enters a room, they find **a mirror version of themselves, sitting at the table, holding a document labeled with the player’s name.** The **reflection looks up and smiles.**

#### **Atmospheric Mechanics & Effects**
- **Laughter echoes from empty rooms, stopping the moment someone enters.**
- **If the players linger too long in one area, they feel watched—but turning around, they see only their own shadows, stretched unnaturally.**
- **Drinks poured here taste fine, but after consuming them, players might find their shadows moving independently for a moment.**
- **If a player stands near a window too long, their reflection briefly shows someone else staring back.**

---

### **3rd-4th Floors**
These floors are filled with **twisted luxury residential apartments**, resembling an **opulent 1920s hotel**, but **something is deeply wrong.** The hallways stretch too far, doors appear where they shouldn’t, and **sometimes, the players leave a room only to find themselves back at the entrance.** The residents are **Strahd’s most loyal enforcers and elite vampires**, their lavish suites doubling as dens of horror. **Ghosts of past tenants wander the halls, forever trapped in looping moments of their final days.**

#### **Hallway Mechanics & Traps**
1. **Shifting Hallways** – Corridors bend, stretch, or **twist upside down when no one is looking.** Players might enter a room and exit to a **different part of the floor.**
2. **Looping Doors** – Some doors open to **the same hallway they just left**, or even worse, **an identical room where something is slightly off.**
3. **The Red Elevator** – A sleek **gold-and-marble elevator** always arrives **before the players call it**, but stepping inside **sometimes takes them back to the same floor—or a floor that shouldn’t exist.**
4. **The Vanishing Bellhop** – A **ghostly bellhop** sometimes appears, offering help, but if spoken to, **his mouth moves soundlessly, and his eyes are filled with writhing darkness.**
5. **The Distant Phone Call** – A telephone rings down the hall. If answered, the caller whispers: **"Don’t go into Room [random number]."** D24 roll

##### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **Ghostly & Time-Warped Suites**
1. **The Looping Honeymoon Suite** – A couple’s **ghostly echoes repeat their final evening.** They toast, dance, and then suddenly, **one stabs the other, only for the scene to reset.**
2. **The Window to Nowhere** – A room with a **gorgeous city view—except none of the buildings match the real city.** If someone stares too long, **a dark figure approaches from the distance.**
3. **The Party That Never Ends** – Music, laughter, and clinking glasses can be heard behind the door. Inside, spectral figures **celebrate endlessly—but their bodies are decayed, and they do not acknowledge their state.**
4. **The Time Trap Parlor** – An elegant suite with a **massive grandfather clock**. Every minute spent here **ages the players by 1d4 years.** The clock **cannot be stopped**—except by removing its **beating, organic heart.**
5. **The Twin Rooms** – Two identical rooms, side by side. If two players enter separately, **they see themselves sitting in the other room, but their reflections do not mimic them.**
6. **The Repeating Suicide** – A lavish bedroom where a nobleman’s ghost **throws himself off the balcony every few minutes**, vanishing before he hits the ground—only to reset moments later.
7. **The Distorted Nursery** – A child’s nursery, filled with **toys that occasionally move on their own**. The mobile above the crib **spins in reverse, whispering names that the players recognize.**
###### **Rooms Occupied by Strahd’s Enforcers & Vampires**
8. **The Blood Lounge** – A dimly lit sitting room where **a group of vampires play cards**. They pause when the players enter, smiling, and **invite them to play for their lives.**
9. **The Mirror Trap** – A bathroom lined with **floor-to-ceiling mirrors**. If a player looks into one too long, **their reflection steps forward, attempting to switch places.**
10. **The Feeding Den** – A large dining room with **a massive oak table, set for a feast**. The "food" on the plates **shifts—sometimes normal, sometimes raw, sometimes rotten flesh.** A **gaunt vampire sits at the head of the table, waiting.**
11. **The Bleeding Wardrobe** – A **massive armoire** filled with extravagant clothing. If opened, **blood drips from the fabric**, and something **twitches inside the hanging coats.**
12. **The Hunting Trophy Room** – Heads of **various creatures—including humans—are mounted on the walls.** One of the heads **blinks at the players.**
13. **Belasco's** - Home of [[Escher Belasco]].
###### **Curious & Unsettling Hotel Rooms**
13. **The Room With No Door** – A perfectly normal suite—except there is **no door to leave.**
14. **The Flooded Ballroom** – A **grand ballroom filled with knee-deep water.** Ghostly dancers **waltz above the surface** as if the floor still exists. The water is **deeper than it appears.**
15. **The Hall of Empty Frames** – A room where **dozens of paintings hang, but all of them are blank.** If a player stares too long, **a blurry version of themselves appears in one.**
16. **The Calliope Room** – A suite with a **massive, self-playing calliope organ.** The music is **discordant** and **strangely hypnotic**. Players who listen for too long **must succeed on a Wisdom save or be compelled to dance until exhaustion.**
###### **Haunted & Cursed Rooms**
17. **The Crying Room** – A luxurious bedroom where a woman’s **agonized sobbing can be heard.** If the party investigates, **no one is there—but the crying continues, coming from everywhere at once.**
18. **The Hands Behind the Curtain** – Heavy velvet curtains **cover every wall**, and if disturbed, **pale, clawed hands reach out—but they never seem to belong to a full body.**
19. **The Room of Names** – A study where **the walls are covered in thousands of names, written in ink, blood, and scratches.** Some of the names are **recognizable to the players.**
20. **The Music Box Room** – A simple guest room with **a single music box on the bed.** When opened, **a distant scream echoes from within, followed by a child’s lullaby.**
###### **Unexplainable Phenomena Rooms**
21. **The Hallway Within A Room** – Opening the door reveals **another, much longer hallway inside, lined with identical doors.** The hallway is **larger than the room should allow.**
22. **The Clockwork Suite** – A luxurious bedroom where **every single object (the bed, chairs, table) slowly ticks like clockwork, moving in tiny mechanical increments.**
23. **The Fractured Room** – This room is **broken into separate pieces of space, floating slightly apart.** Walking across the room **shifts gravity, pulling players toward different walls.**
24. **The Breathless Chamber** – The air in this room is **thin and stale, making it difficult to breathe.** No matter how long players stay, they never feel like they’ve fully caught their breath.

##### **Additional Twisting Hallway Mechanics**
- **Sometimes, doors open to the wrong rooms, even if players are certain they came from elsewhere.**
- **Shadows stretch unnaturally long in the hallways, moving when no one is watching.**
- **Whispers call players by name, but only when they are alone.**
- **When players pass a hallway mirror, one of them briefly sees a version of themselves with hollow eyes, staring back.**

---

### **5th Floor**
A **vast, labyrinthine library**, **twisting and shifting** as if it has a mind of its own. The air is thick with **arcane whispers**, and the smell of **old parchment and candle smoke lingers.** This is a **repository of forbidden knowledge**, filled with **books on occult secrets, forgotten gods, and lost histories.** The shelves seem **endless**, and **some books should not be read.**

###### **The Arcane Archives**
- A secret passage leads to **Strahd’s personal study**, where notes on the Elder God are scrawled in incomprehensible glyphs.
- **Shifting Shelves** – The bookshelves slowly **move when no one is looking**, **closing pathways** and opening **new ones.**
- **Librarian Spirits** – **Ghostly, faceless librarians** float silently through the aisles, **organizing books.** If disturbed, they react **violently**.
- **The Index of the Lost** – A massive, **self-writing ledger** records every book in the library, but some **titles erase themselves** as the party searches.
- **The Whispering Books** – Some tomes whisper in **unintelligible tongues**, their **voices worming into the minds of readers**, forcing **Intelligence saving throws to resist obsession.**
- **The False Exits** – Doorways lead to **different places than expected**, some **looping back to where they started** while others open into **impossible rooms.**
- **The Flickering Candles** – The library is dimly lit by **thousands of candles**, but **some burn backwards**, and others **snuff out when approached.**
- **The Eyes in the Stacks** – Occasionally, players catch glimpses of **something watching them from between the shelves, but it vanishes when pursued.**
- **Book Mimics** – Some books are **not books at all**. When opened, they **bite down and attempt to drain knowledge from the reader's mind.**
- **The Time-Locked Tomes** – Some books **contain events that unfold as they are read**, briefly pulling the reader **into the past** before snapping them back.
- **The Forbidden Section** – A **sealed wing of the library**, filled with **books wrapped in chains**. Reading them **requires a blood sacrifice.**

#### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **The Candlelit Chamber**
This **dark study** is illuminated by a single, floating candle. Any book read here **reveals additional notes in the margins**—notes written by **someone in the future, warning of upcoming dangers.**
###### **The Reflection Room**
A **reading parlor with no bookshelves, only mirrors.** Readers must **speak the title of a book, and it appears in their reflection.** However, **sometimes the reflection changes what is written.**
###### **The Drifting Study**
A chamber where **tables, chairs, and bookshelves float gently in zero gravity.** Reading here allows **readers to glimpse alternate versions of reality**—some better, some much worse.
###### **The Silent Vault**
A **soundless chamber**, lined with **books encased in glass**. The silence is **absolute**, preventing all verbal speech. Some books **can only be read here—outside, their pages appear blank.** There is a suit of [[CR6 Strahd's Animated Armor]] in the vault. If players walk near it, it comes to life.
###### **The Endless Desk**
A **massive mahogany desk stretches into the distance**, lined with **identical lamps and chairs.** Sitting here allows readers to **read twice as fast**, but **hours pass in minutes.**

### **6th-7th Floors**
Unlike the floors below, which **dripped with decadence and occult mystery,** these floors feel oddly… **mundane.** These are the **beating heart of Strahd’s operations**, where paperwork and bureaucracy keep his empire in order. **Office spaces stretch endlessly**, filled with **typewriters, rolodexes, and rows of desks where workers once sat.** But the silence is **unnatural**, and the air **crackles with unseen tension.** Something **is still here.**

#### **Atmosphere & Mechanics**
- **The Hum of the Machines** – Though the workers are long gone, the typewriters still click away, the **telephones ring with no one to answer,** and **radios crackle with unintelligible whispers.**
- **The Cold Draft** – No matter how well-dressed the players are, an **icy chill** permeates the air, sinking into their bones. Any attempts to **light fires or heat sources are quickly extinguished.**
- **Phantom Office Workers** – Occasionally, a player might glimpse **shadowy figures seated at desks, filing papers, or walking to meetings**—only for them to **vanish when directly approached.**
- **Sudden Disturbances** – Without warning, **a drawer slams shut, a chair skitters across the floor, a typewriter dings violently, or a whole filing cabinet tips over with a deafening crash.** These are **harmless… at first.**
- **The Surveillance Files** – A locked filing cabinet contains **hundreds of files on the party**, documenting **their past, their fears, and events that have not yet happened.**

###### **Twisting Hallways & Paranormal Mechanics**
1. **Endless Corridors** – Hallways loop back **unnaturally**, making navigation difficult without marking paths.
2. **Time Distortions** – A clock ticks loudly, but every time players check it, **a different amount of time has passed.**
3. **The Invisible Worker** – Players hear the sound of **someone typing aggressively**, but no one is there. If investigated, **a fresh document appears on the typewriter, detailing their every move.**
4. **Doors That Lock Behind Them** – Some rooms seal shut **after entry**, requiring creative solutions to escape.

#### **Paranormal Encounters**
1. **The Poltergeist Tempest** – As the players move deeper into the office floors, a **violent storm of flying objects** (staplers, chairs, phones) erupts. Using **paranormal detection equipment** can pinpoint the source, allowing them to **banish the entity.**
2. **Possessed Telephones** – If a phone rings and a player answers, they will hear a **distorted version of their own voice** describing their **exact movements in real-time**—but one second in the future.
3. **The Watercooler Phantom** – The breakroom’s **water cooler is full of black ichor.** If anyone drinks from it, they **hear whispers in an alien tongue** and must succeed on a **Wisdom save** or experience **visions of their own death.**
4. **Hostile Apparitions** – Ghostly **office workers in 1920s business attire** roam the halls, their **faces warped and shifting.** They do not respond to communication, but if attacked, they **unleash a burst of psychic torment.**
5. **The "Closed-Door" Meeting** – A **conference room door is locked.** If the players listen in, they hear **muffled voices debating something sinister.** If opened, the **room is empty, except for chairs still rocking, as if just vacated.**

- **The coffee pot brews by itself, but the liquid is thick, black, and moves unnaturally.**
- **The fridge rattles occasionally—if opened, it contains rotting food and a severed hand still clutching a pen.**
- **A vending machine dispenses items that don’t exist (e.g., "Unfiltered Dreamwater," "Moonlit Cigarettes," "Lunch from Yesterday").**
###### **The Common Area**
- A lounge space with **plush chairs, a roaring (but cold) fireplace, and a grand piano that plays itself.**
- **If players sit down too long, they feel overwhelmingly tired and risk falling into a lucid nightmare.**
- **A ghostly janitor mops the floor, but refuses to acknowledge intruders.** If spoken to, he **briefly flickers into a rotting corpse before vanishing.**
###### **The Surveillance Room**
- **Rows of security monitors display live footage of the Lofts—but sometimes, they show impossible angles, past events, or the players themselves from behind.**
- **A locked file cabinet contains documents describing past "incidents" in the Lofts, detailing employees who went missing in ways eerily similar to how the party has handled past encounters.**
- **A single, ringing phone sits on a desk. If answered, a voice whispers, “I see you.”**

---

### **8th Floor**
By the time the players reach the **8th floor**, the Lofts **begin rejecting reality itself.** This floor **warps perception, distorts time, and twists reflections into something sinister.** Every surface here feels **wrong**, as if the players are **walking through a place that exists between worlds.**
- **Mirrors line the hallways, but the reflections don’t always match reality.**
- **Shadows flicker and move independently, stretching unnaturally.**
- **Doors appear and vanish at random**, leading to nowhere—or somewhere they **shouldn’t.**
- **Time loops, forcing the players to relive moments in fragmented visions.**
- **Reflections whisper secrets or scream warnings, but never at the right time.**

#### **Mechanics & Hazards**

###### **The Fractured Office**
- An abandoned **office space** with overturned desks and scattered papers.
- If a player reads a document, **they hear a voice reading it back—seconds before they actually start reading.**
- Leaving the room resets everything, and the same papers **now describe the players' actions moments before.**
###### **The Distorted Lounge**
- A **lavish break room** with plush chairs, a bar, and soft jazz playing from a record player.
- Everything seems normal, until the players see their reflections **sitting, drinking, and laughing on their own.**
- If interacted with, **one reflection leans over and whispers, “You shouldn’t be here.”**
- **Touching anything causes the illusion to flicker**, revealing **an abandoned, rotting version of the room.**
###### **The Glass Labyrinth**

- Players see **shadows moving in reflections** that aren’t there when they turn.
- **Their own reflections begin walking ahead of them, making choices before they do.**
- At the center of the maze is **a glass pedestal holding an ornate key**—but reaching it may require **breaking part of themselves.**
###### **The Black Reflection**
- A small, dark room with **a single mirror at the far end.**
- Looking into the mirror **reveals a copy of the player, but something is wrong—its eyes are completely black.**
- If they turn away, they **hear footsteps approaching from behind.**
- If they break the mirror, **their double steps out, fully formed, and attacks.**
###### **The Hall of Doors**
- A long hallway filled with identical black doors.
- Some doors lead to **normal offices**, others lead to **endless voids or looping hallways.**
- One door opens to a **perfect copy of the previous floor**, trapping players in a loop unless they notice the slight differences.
- **Some doors vanish behind them after passing through.**
###### **The Portrait Room**
- A grand room filled with **paintings of past executives and workers.**
- The paintings **change subtly** each time the players look away—figures **move**, **faces twist into nightmares**, or **eyes start bleeding black ichor.**
- One painting **depicts the players, but slightly different**, as if an **alternate version of them was here before.**
- The only way out is through **a portrait that serves as a hidden passageway**—but first, they must **solve the mystery of the missing face.**

---

### **9th-10th Floors**
As the party ascends to **floors 9 and 10**, the Lofts **begin shedding their mask of urban civility.** The walls become **slick, pulsing, and veined with something dark and alive.** The structure itself feels like it's becoming a **living organism**, sustained by an unknown force.
- **The air is thick, humid, and smells of blood and rust.**
- **Hallways seem organic, like they're shifting and breathing.**
- **Strange whispers and distant heartbeats echo through the corridors.**
- **Light sources flicker or turn into burning red orbs, watching the players.**

These floors serve as **the heart of Strahd’s power**, where the line between **architecture and flesh** has completely blurred. They are the **feeding grounds** for his most terrifying creations and the **last threshold before reaching his domain.**

#### **Mechanics & Hazards**
- **Living Walls** – The walls **shift and pulse**, sometimes sealing off paths or opening new ones.
- **Sanguine Doors** – Doors require **blood sacrifices** to open, either by spilling the players' own blood or finding an offering.
- **Sentient Floor** – Certain sections **grab and drag** players toward dark pits unless they resist.
- **Blood Drenched Visions** – The party experiences **horrific flashbacks of past victims**, making them question their own memories.
- **The Heartbeat** – A steady **thumping sound** grows louder as they ascend, making it harder to focus and fueling paranoia.

#### **Special Encounters & Twists**
- **The Sanguine Guardian** – A **twisted vampire monstrosity** fused into the walls, attacking with **tendrils of blood.**
- **Echoes of the Damned** – Specters of **past victims**, doomed to repeat their last moments, **driving players mad if they listen too long.**
- **Bloodborne Lurkers** – Creatures that **rise from the black pools**, seeking to **bind with living flesh.**
- **The Forbidden Ritual** – A ritual chamber where **Strahd first received his vampiric gift.** If undone, it could **weaken him—but at what cost?**

#### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **The Vein Tunnel**
- A **long hallway lined with pulsating red veins** that glow faintly in the dark.
- The floor **quivers underfoot**, as if walking on **muscle.**
- Occasionally, the veins **contract**, blocking paths or trapping players.
###### **The Thirsting Chamber**
- A room filled with **ancient bloodletting tools and sacrificial altars.**
- If a player enters, **the doors seal shut, and the walls begin to exude blood.**
- A whispering voice demands a **sacrifice**, draining **hit points** from anyone inside until the demand is met.
###### **The Maw Hall**
- A passage where the **ceiling and walls resemble rows of jagged teeth.**
- If the players move too quickly, the “mouth” **snaps shut**, forcing them to **pry it open** or suffer immense damage.
- **Creatures stalk within the walls**, waiting for prey to stumble.
###### **The Bleeding Office**
- A high-end office completely drenched in **fresh, dripping blood.**
- Papers are **soaked through**, yet words appear clearly, revealing **horrible truths about Strahd’s victims.**
- If players read too much, **their own names begin appearing on the documents.**
###### **The Husk Storage**
- A dark room **filled with hundreds of empty, hanging skins.**
- They **flutter as if breathing,** but when touched, they **collapse into dust.**
- One husk is **still inhabited**, a prisoner **screaming for release—but something inside refuses to let go.**
###### **The Feeding Chamber**
- A central pit **filled with twitching bodies**, still alive but **drained of essence.**
- **Strahd’s blood servants** come here to feed and dispose of corpses.
- If disturbed, **some husks rise as ravenous, blood-starved wretches.**
###### **The Flesh Library**
- Bookshelves **made of cartilage and bone**, with tomes **bound in stretched skin.**
- The books contain **eldritch rituals**, some useful, others **cursed.**

- Strahd himself may briefly **appear as a shadow**, taunting them before disappearing.

---

### **11th Floor**
By the time the party reaches **Floor 11**, the Lofts **barely resemble a physical space anymore.** This is where **Strahd’s connection to the Elder God is strongest**, and the building is no longer just architecture—it is an **extension of something beyond human comprehension.**
- **The floorplan shifts constantly.** Rooms appear where there were none, corridors stretch infinitely or snap back to nothingness.
- **Gravity is inconsistent.** Walking in one direction might send a player **upside-down**, or they may find themselves **falling into a hallway below that they already passed through.**
- **Time loops and distorts.** Players may see **echoes of themselves entering rooms before they do** or find that **actions they haven’t taken yet have already happened.**
- **Strahd’s influence is omnipresent.** His laughter, whispers, and shadowy figure **appear in places where he is not physically present.**

Floor 11 should feel like the **breaking point before reaching Strahd himself.** It should **erode the party’s sense of self and reality, forcing them to question everything.**

#### **Mechanics & Hazards**
- **Unstable Dimensions** – Stepping through one doorway may **deposit players into an entirely different part of the floor** or **split the party across multiple dimensions.**
- **Reality Collapse** – Some sections of the floor simply **cease to exist**, leading into an endless void. If a player steps too close, they risk **being erased.**
- **Echoing Deaths** – If a party member dies on this floor, **they don’t disappear.** Instead, their past self keeps walking, unaware of their death, until they witness it happening.
- **Reverse Cause and Effect** – Players may experience **effects before the actions that caused them,** such as a bullet wound appearing before a shot is fired.

#### **Special Encounters & Twists**
###### **The Archivist of the Void**
A **floating, tentacled being**, its "head" a massive, **flickering eye** filled with shifting runes.
- It knows **everything the party has ever done** and **offers glimpses into their futures**—but at a price.
- If attacked, **it splits into multiple versions of itself, each existing in a different time period.**
###### **The Doppelgänger Gambit**
At some point, the players find **copies of themselves**, **identical in every way**.
- The copies claim **they are the real ones,** and the players are the **impostors.**
- If the party hesitates too long, the copies **begin taking their place, stealing memories, equipment, and abilities.**
###### **The Blood Debt Collector**
A **twisted humanoid** in a three-piece suit, its **face a black void with sharp, white teeth.**
- It is here to **settle old debts**—debts **owed to Strahd.**
- The players must offer **a memory, a part of their soul, or someone else's life** to proceed.
- If refused, it **summons blood-written contracts** that attempt to **bind the party in place.**
###### **The Time Snarl**
A **room that exists in multiple time periods at once.**
- **Past and future versions of the party** flicker in and out of existence.
- **Actions taken in the room retroactively alter their past experiences**, sometimes **undoing things they’ve done earlier in the campaign.**

#### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **The Infinite Corridor**
- A **hallway lined with doors** that seems to go on forever.
- **Doors open to impossible places**, like the party’s own past, an unknown future, or places they haven’t visited.

- **If they turn back, they encounter themselves just arriving.**
###### **The Fractured Boardroom**
- A massive **conference room**, but the long table is **split into floating pieces**, suspended in mid-air.
- **Gravity rotates every few minutes**, forcing players to jump between table pieces.
- Strahd’s **former business partners are seated around the table**, their bodies stretched into unnatural shapes, whispering **secrets about his rise to power.**
- The moment the players turn away, the partners’ **heads violently twist toward them, whispering their own names.**
###### **The Mirror Nexus**
- A chamber lined with **massive mirrors**, but none of them reflect reality properly.
- Instead, each mirror shows a **different version of the party**—some **older**, some **monstrous**, some **already dead.**
- **Stepping into the wrong reflection may trap them inside,** forcing them to navigate a distorted world of their own past choices.
- Some reflections **move independently, stepping out of the mirror to attack.**
###### **The Red Ledger**
- A **gigantic floating ledger** filled with **names**, each crossed out in **red ink**—except for the party’s.
- Every time they look away, **new names are added.**
- Players can attempt to **erase their own names**, but this might cause **time to fold in on itself, undoing their entire existence.**
- A **ghostly accountant**, faceless and hunched, **shuffles through the ledger, mumbling about "final debts."**
###### **The Clockwork Womb**
- A pulsating **organic machine** made of metal and flesh, **gears dripping with blood.**
- A **heartbeat echoes through the chamber**, syncing with the players’ own.
- If touched, the machine **attempts to rewrite a player’s existence, changing their class, age, or even species.**
- Strahd’s **voice seeps through the walls**, offering a "rebirth" in exchange for servitude.

---

### **12th Floor**
Floor 12 is where **illusion meets reality once more**—a return to the structured, corporate world of The Lofts, yet something is **deeply, fundamentally wrong.** Unlike the surreal horror of Floor 11, this level feels eerily **normal**—but the **oppressive aura of Strahd’s absolute control hangs heavy.**
- The **hallways are pristine**, the walls lined with **rich mahogany paneling**, and the floor is **polished black marble**.
- A **strange quiet fills the air**—no music, no voices, only the ticking of a **grand clock above the receptionist’s desk.**
- **The ghosts of former employees**, wearing outdated suits, **drift through the halls**, endlessly carrying paperwork between rooms.

It is **one of the most dangerous floors**, not because reality is collapsing, but because **everything is inescapably controlled by Strahd.**

Floor 12 is the **final threshold** before facing Strahd directly. It **reintroduces structure and familiarity**, only for it to be **twisted into the most insidious version of corporate horror.** It **forces players to play by Strahd’s rules—bureaucracy, contracts, and waiting—until they find a way to break free.**

#### **Key Features & Rooms**
###### **The Receptionist’s Domain**
- A **grand lobby** with a **massive curved desk**, a **large clock above it**, and **one single receptionist sitting behind it.**
- **Dahlia Mercer**, Strahd’s **undead, hyper-efficient receptionist**, is **tall, thin, and exudes an air of absolute authority.**
- Her **thin glasses reflect nothing**, and **her skeletal fingers tap impatiently against a typewriter.**
- She **does not allow anyone to see Strahd without an appointment.**
- **Players must navigate bureaucracy**, forging documents, persuading her, or finding another way in—**failing to do so results in being placed in The Eternal Waiting Room.**
###### **Encounter: The Overbearing Receptionist**
- **Dahlia Mercer is no mere undead.** If provoked, she **removes her glasses**, revealing **void-filled eyes.**
- **Her voice becomes a chorus** of every lost employee, and **paperwork binds the players in place.**
- **Abilities include:**
    - **Bureaucratic Bindings** – Forces players to make endless **charisma checks** to “fill out forms” or be restrained.
    - **Time Delay** – Players who **fail checks are temporarily “rewound”** back to the lobby entrance.
    - **The Stamp of Doom** – A **red ink stamp** brands players with the word **"DENIED."** Any attack rolls against Strahd **automatically fail** until the curse is removed.

###### **The Eternal Waiting Room**
- A **large, sterile waiting room** filled with **soulless office chairs and stacks of outdated magazines.**
- **A dozen ghosts sit quietly**, checking their watches, muttering, **"Any minute now…"**
- **Time flows strangely**—the longer players stay, the more they **age, forget their purpose, or fall into an endless loop of waiting.**
- **One ghost has been waiting for centuries**, convinced his name is **next on the list.**
- The only way out is to **steal the receptionist’s appointment book** and write their names at the top.
###### **Mechanic: The Endless Appointment Delay**
- Every few minutes, **a disembodied voice calls out names**—**none of which belong to the players.**
- Players can attempt to **trick the system**, but if they fail, their **own names disappear from reality for 1 hour.**

###### **The Executive Lounge**
- A **lavish bar and lounge**, seemingly prepared for **Strahd’s most elite guests.**
- A **piano plays itself** in the corner, and glasses **fill with deep red liquid**—but **it is not wine.**
- The **specters of former business moguls**, long indebted to Strahd, **sit and drink, laughing hollowly.**
- A **massive window** gives an impossible **view of The Lofts from the outside**, as if **the building stretches infinitely downward.**
###### **Encounter: The Indentured Bar Patrons**
- The patrons **offer the players a toast**, but drinking the wine **binds them to a contract they never signed.**
- **Attempts to leave without drinking are met with hostility**, as the patrons morph into **ghastly, skeletal enforcers.**

###### **The Deal Room**
- A **massive negotiation chamber**, where **Strahd once made his most ruthless business deals.**
- A **long black table sits at the center**, **ink-stained contracts** floating in the air.
- If players step inside, **they are immediately seated, and the doors lock behind them.**
###### **Encounter: The Living Contract**
- **A spectral quill floats toward the players, forcing them to "sign."**
- Signing means **agreeing to a term they do not yet know**—but if they **refuse, the ink begins to crawl toward them.**
- The **ink monster** rises from the contracts, attempting to **consume them in legal loopholes and eldritch fine print.**

###### **Strahd’s Office**
- **A massive penthouse office, lined with dark wood and floor-to-ceiling windows.**
- Strahd’s **ornate desk sits in the center**, the city skyline stretching infinitely beyond the glass.
- **A single glass of wine** rests on his desk, untouched.
- Strahd is either **seated casually, waiting for the players, or nowhere to be found.**
###### **Final Encounter Mechanics**
- **The windows reveal not a city, but an endless void of stars.**
- **The office itself shifts**, with the walls stretching into infinity if combat begins.
- **Strahd’s shadow moves independently**, attacking from angles the players don’t expect.
- **If the battle goes on too long, the entire floor begins collapsing into the void, pulling everyone toward the abyss.**
