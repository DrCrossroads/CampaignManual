A grim, soot-stained building near the steel mills and railyards, **The Iron Ward** is a **no-nonsense, brutal precinct** where officers deal with gang enforcers, striking workers, and smuggling rings. The cops here are either **tough, corrupt, or broken** by the weight of their work.

#### **Key Officers**
- **Captain Orson "Iron" McGraw (LN, Human)** – A **hardened veteran** with **a steel prosthetic hand**, rumored to have lost it in a factory accident—or a gang dispute. He has **little patience for bureaucracy** and believes in **pragmatic justice** over strict legality.
- **Detective Regina "Reggie" Holt (N, Half-Orc)** – A **rough, chain-smoking detective** who drinks too much but knows **every gang boss and black-market deal** in the district.
- **Officer Tommy Doyle (CN, Human)** – A **young beat cop** from a working-class family, caught **between the law and loyalty to his striking relatives**.

#### **Quest Hooks**
- A **series of "accidents"** at the steel mill seem **too convenient**, and McGraw suspects **a rival gang is sabotaging production**.
- **Reggie Holt** asks the players to look into **a missing enforcer**, who was last seen taking **a bribe from a factory owner**.
- **Tommy Doyle** quietly approaches the party, saying **his brother is missing** after trying to **expose corruption in the precinct**.
