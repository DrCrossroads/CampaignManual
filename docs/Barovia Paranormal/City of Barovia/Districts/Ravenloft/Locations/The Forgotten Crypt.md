- **Location**: Beneath the [[House of the Rising Flame]] lies a crypt, untouched for over 100 years. It’s only accessible through a forgotten trapdoor in the church's basement, hidden behind stacks of old pews and crates of church supplies.
- **Hauntings**: The crypt holds not only the remains of the city’s founders but also a dark secret—one of the original benefactors made a pact with a dark entity, and the crypt was used for strange rites. At night, visitors hear whispers and feel an overwhelming dread, as if they’re being watched by unseen eyes.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: There is an unfinished ritual in the crypt, one that could tear open the fabric between the worlds if completed. Some say the entity is stirring, waiting for someone to finish it.

## Nursery Rhyme
Locked away, a tale untold,
The crypt was sealed in days of old.
Dare to open, dare to see,
And what was lost may now be free.

Stone on stone, name unknown,
Sleep below, rest alone.
But knock three times and speak too loud,
The crypt may open—death is proud.

Beneath the stones, beneath the past,
Lies truth the city sealed in glass.
A whispered oath, a broken vow,
The founders watch, they linger now.
A silver key, a rusted gate—
To wake them is to share their fate.

### **3. The Founder’s Chamber (Main Crypt Area)**

- A grand, vaulted chamber containing rows of **ornate stone sarcophagi**, each inscribed with the names of the city’s founders.
- A massive, **cracked cathedral window** (even though it’s underground) depicts a **faceless figure offering a book to kneeling worshippers**.
- The floor is **inlaid with a sigil**, half-covered in dust. It appears to be part of an unfinished ritual.

**Encounter:**
- If someone **clears the dust off the sigil**, the whispers grow louder, and a **ghostly figure in tattered priest robes** appears near the window.

    > _"The last piece. The final word. Speak it, and the gate will open."_
- It **attempts to coerce or possess** one of the party members into speaking the final phrase of the unfinished ritual.

## **Paranormal Investigation Mechanics**

**(These mechanics add depth to investigations and allow players to interact with the hauntings in unique ways.)**

### **1. EVP Recordings (Electronic Voice Phenomena)**
- If players use recording devices, they may **capture voices that weren’t heard in real-time**.
- Potential recordings include:
    - **"Not finished… must finish…**" (Urgent whispering)
    - **"They watch from the dark."**
    - A voice laughing, then suddenly **screaming before cutting out**.

### **2. Temperature Readings & Cold Spots**
- Using temperature-sensing equipment reveals **sharp drops** near:
    - The sigil in the **Founder’s Chamber**.
    - The **altar in the Reliquary**.
    - Any place where an **entity is about to manifest**.

### **3. Spirit Box / Radio Interference**
- A handheld radio might suddenly **switch stations on its own**, tuning into eerie broadcasts.
- Snippets of **old sermons, static-filled confessions, or chilling messages** might be heard.

**Example Spirit Box Responses:**
- "Still waiting…"
- "The last word… must not…"
- "It’s not the priest. It never was."

### **4. Salt & Protective Wards**
- Players might **draw a salt circle** or use **protective symbols**.
- If they attempt to ward off spirits:
    - Some entities will **shrink back** but **watch from a distance**.
    - The **wraith from the book might test the boundary**, causing **salt lines to blacken** and crack.

## **Possible Outcomes**

1. **Seal the Ritual** – Players might find a way to **destroy the sigil** in the crypt before it can be completed. This would result in the hauntings **fading over time**, but **not immediately**.
2. **Banish the Entity** – If they **exorcise** the wraith-like figure from the book, it will **lash out violently** before being cast back into the void.
3. **Complete the Ritual (Bad Ending)** – If a player **gives in to temptation** and **speaks the final word**, the crypt **collapses** into a seemingly endless abyss, leaving the group with **one less member**… or something **else in their place**.
