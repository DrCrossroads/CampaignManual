- **Location**: The city’s old clock tower, a once-proud landmark that overlooks the entire city from a steep hill. It’s been abandoned for years after the mysterious death of the last caretaker, an old man who was found hanging from the tower’s bell rope.
- **Hauntings**: The clock is stuck at midnight, and every night, it tolls three times, despite no one being inside. Residents have reported seeing a shadowy figure watching from the tower’s top floor, and the sound of footsteps pacing around inside. Some claim to have heard the old man’s voice whispering in the wind, pleading for help, while others have seen ghostly figures staring down from the tower windows.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The clock tower is said to be cursed, a result of a failed attempt to use the tower’s mechanism to alter time itself. The ghosts here are bound to the passage of time, forever stuck in a loop of the night of the caretaker's death. Unraveling the curse could mean confronting something that doesn’t belong to this world—a force that bends time.

## Nursery Rhyme
Tick-tock, the gears will turn,
Hands will move, the hours burn.
Wind the watch, but mind the chime,
The master’s lost within his time.

Midnight tolls, the gears stand still,
A shadow moves against its will.
A final chime, a cry, a fall—
No one saw a thing at all.
Yet climb the stairs, and if you dare,
You’ll find his footprints waiting there.

## Overview
The city’s old clock tower, once a proud testament to craftsmanship, now looms like a silent sentinel over the streets below. Its once-pristine stone is weathered and cracked, ivy creeping up its sides. The great clock face, stained and dirt-covered, remains frozen at midnight. Every night, despite the tower’s complete abandonment, the bells toll three times—an ominous sound that echoes eerily through the city.

The interior is just as foreboding. Dust clings to the air in thick layers, disturbed only by unseen movement. The wooden spiral staircase groans underfoot, as if bearing unseen weight. Drafts whisper through the halls, carrying indistinct voices that fade before they can be fully understood.

At the top, the clock’s gears and mechanisms remain still, locked in their frozen state. The old caretaker’s room, just beneath the bell chamber, is untouched since his death—his personal effects, a journal, and his maintenance tools still lie scattered about.

#### **Key Areas**

1. **The Spiral Staircase** – A narrow, wooden staircase winding up the tower, lined with rusted lanterns and frayed ropes. Investigators may hear footsteps ahead or behind them, feel sudden temperature drops, or even see fleeting shadows flicker in the dim light.
2. **The Mechanism Room** – A vast chamber where the massive gears and pendulums of the clock once moved in sync. The silence here is unnerving, occasionally broken by a metallic _clang_ as if something unseen is trying to set the gears in motion again.
3. **The Caretaker’s Room** – A cramped, dusty chamber filled with old ledgers, personal notes, and scattered possessions. A journal here details the caretaker’s growing fear of the clock and his belief that something was watching him from within its gears.
4. **The Bell Chamber** – The highest point in the tower, where the great iron bell looms overhead. The rope still swings slightly, as if moved by invisible hands. Bloodstains are faintly visible on the wooden floor beneath it. The atmosphere here is suffocating, and whispers are strongest in this room.

#### **Paranormal Phenomena**

- **The Shadow in the Window** – A dark figure can be seen from outside, staring down at the city. If approached inside the tower, it vanishes just before being fully seen.
- **Time Distortions** – Watches stop, timepieces malfunction, and investigators may find themselves losing time while inside. A moment’s pause in the mechanism room might turn into an hour without their noticing.
- **Looping Events** – Echoes of past events play out, such as the sound of the caretaker’s footsteps, his voice muttering about the clock “not being right,” or the sound of the bell rope being pulled by unseen hands.
- **Unseen Hands** – Objects shift, tools move on their own, and at times, investigators may feel an unseen force gripping their wrist or pushing them away from the bell chamber.

#### **Encounters**

**1. The Caretaker’s Restless Spirit**
- **Appearance**: A translucent figure, emaciated and weary, his eyes hollow with despair. He is bound to the moment of his death and relives his final night over and over.
- **Interaction**: He pleads for help, warning that the clock must not be restarted. If spoken to with compassion, he reveals that something _inside_ the tower—something old and unnatural—has bound him here.
- **Mechanics**: If an attempt is made to restart the clock, the caretaker’s spirit will become desperate, trying to intervene before fading into nothingness.

**2. The Time-Warping Entity**
- **Appearance**: A shifting, faceless silhouette made of mist and shadow, appearing only in the moments when time distorts.
- **Interaction**: The entity exists _between time_, feeding on moments lost in the tower. It lures investigators into loops, trapping them in the night of the caretaker’s death.
- **Mechanics**:
    - **Temporal Rift**: The entity can cause moments to repeat or erase memories of certain actions.
    - **Frozen in Time**: If a player stares into the clock’s gears too long, they may find themselves reliving a past moment while their body remains frozen in place.
    - **Final Confrontation**: If the investigators attempt to break the curse, the entity lashes out, trying to bind them to the tower’s eternal loop.

#### **Breaking the Curse**

- **Option 1: Destroy the Clock** – Smashing the frozen gears and shattering the bell will sever the entity’s anchor to the material world, freeing the caretaker’s spirit.
- **Option 2: Restart Time** – If the clock is painstakingly repaired and set back in motion, time may correct itself, allowing the caretaker’s soul to pass on and ending the nightly hauntings.
- **Option 3: Bargain with the Entity** – It may offer the investigators something _in exchange for time_—a glimpse into the past or future, in return for being allowed to persist. Accepting its deal binds them to its influence.

#### **Conclusion**

Whether they destroy the clock, restore it, or fall prey to the tower’s dark presence, the investigators will leave with the unsettling knowledge that time itself is not always a fixed, reliable force—and that some things are meant to be forgotten.
