Residence of [[Mordenkainen, the Mad Mage]].

A decayed **three-story mansion** built on the remains of an older structure, its architecture an unsettling mix of Baroque, Gothic, and Art Deco styles. Strange symbols pulse faintly on the exterior, shifting when observed too long. The front door, an iron construct covered in arcane locks, **never seems to be in the same place twice**.

Inside, the **laws of time and space break down**. Hallways loop back on themselves. Mirrors reflect things that aren't there. The whispers of long-dead scholars beg for help—but some **want something far worse**.

- **General Atmosphere**: The manor exists in **a state of flux**, constantly shifting between past grandeur and present decay. Clocks **tick backward**, rooms **rearrange themselves**, and **echoes of the past** replay in glimpses of fading light.
- **Unique Manor Mechanic**:
    - Players can **find keys, artifacts, or memories** that **alter rooms**, returning them to their former state or revealing **hidden passages**.
    - **Time-Warping Effects** (e.g., a player suddenly sees themselves performing an action **they haven't done yet**).
    - **The Manor’s Awareness**: The house **responds to intruders**, shifting architecture or unleashing **spectral echoes** that mimic the players.

## Key Areas
### **1. The Foyer of Fractured Time**

_A twisting entry hall where reality loops upon itself._

- **Description**:
    - A grand, **mahogany staircase** splits into two upper hallways.
    - The chandelier **flickers between glowing with warm candlelight and hanging rusted and shattered**.
    - **Paintings shift**—portraits of the same person at different ages, sometimes **watching the players**.
    - Doors appear **in different locations** depending on when the players look.

- **Encounters**:
    - **Echo of the Past (Non-Combat)**: A spectral **illusion of Mordenkainen** greets them, but his words **are fragmented** between multiple timelines. (“...the cycle…Strahd’s curse...the key...before it’s too late.”)
    - **Time Loops**: If a player **steps into a certain area**, they **repeat their last action involuntarily** (e.g., drawing a weapon again, repeating dialogue, reliving a few seconds).
    - **Unstable Time Remnants** (Combat, CR 4 Encounter): **Animated reflections** of the players step out of nearby mirrors and **attempt to kill them, believing they are the impostors**.

---

### **2. The Library of Forbidden Tomes**

_The walls whisper as the books themselves try to read you._

- **Description**:
    
    - **Rows of decayed bookshelves** that **shift slightly when unobserved**.
    - The scent of **old parchment and something wet and rotting**.
    - A massive, open book at the center of the room **flips its own pages**.
    - **A chalk summoning circle, partially erased**, hints at **past experiments gone wrong**.
- **Encounters & Interactions**:
    
    - **The Whispers of Knowledge**: Reading a book **might grant insight** (_advantage on Arcana checks for 1 hour_), but **some pages drain knowledge instead** (_Intelligence saving throw or lose proficiency in a skill temporarily_).
    - **Bound Librarian (Undead, CR 5 Encounter)**: The **skeletal remains** of the librarian float, still **bound to serve**, asking riddles or attacking if players remove certain books.
    - **The Book of Cycles**: If opened, it **flashes with dark energy**, revealing visions of **past adventurers who tried and failed to stop the cycle**.

---

### **3. The Observatory of Unblinking Eyes**

_The sky does not obey natural laws._

- **Description**:
    
    - A massive glass dome, but **the stars outside do not match any known constellations**.
    - **The telescope is aimed at a dark patch of the sky** where no stars exist.
    - The telescope whispers, as if **something is whispering back** from the void.
    - The furniture here **floats slightly above the ground**.
- **Encounters & Interactions**:
    
    - **Looking Through the Telescope**: A player glimpses **past, future, or parallel versions of themselves** (_DM’s choice, could be helpful or horrifying_).
    - **Manifested Starlight (CR 5 Encounter)**: A cosmic horror, resembling a **shimmering void of limbs and shifting eyes**, attacks when they interact with the telescope.

---

### **4. The Arcane Laboratory (Heart of the Manor)**

_Mordenkainen’s greatest works—and greatest failures—lie here._

- **Description**:
    
    - **Arcane rings** of shifting symbols float midair, remnants of half-cast spells.
    - **Machines powered by raw magic flicker and sputter**, releasing sparks.
    - **The incomplete Device**, which was meant to sever Strahd’s link to the Elder God, remains intact but **unstable**.
- **Encounters & Interactions**:
    
    - **Spell Traps**: Some floating glyphs contain **unreleased spells** that **activate randomly** (Fireball, Counterspell, Teleportation).
    - **The Broken Machine**: The players can **fix the machine**, learning that it **was meant to shatter the cycle** but failed.
    - **The Memory of Failure (CR 6 Encounter)**: A ghostly **past version of Mordenkainen**, still sane, **begs them to stop him before he completes the ritual and goes mad**.

---

### **5. The Rift Chamber (Basement Catacombs)**

_The place where it all fell apart._

- **Description**:
    
    - **Walls pulse like flesh**, covered in **arcane sigils** burned into the stone.
    - **A cracked mirror** in the center **seeps shadows**—a failed doorway to the Elder God’s domain.
    - The sound of **Mordenkainen’s screams from the past** still lingers.
- **Encounters & Interactions**:
    
    - **The Fragment of the Elder God (CR 7 Boss Fight)**: A grotesque, shifting **entity** trying to break free through the mirror.
    - **Closing the Rift**: Players must **rewrite sigils**, but mistakes **cause eldritch horrors to leak into reality**.

### **6. The Hall of Echoes**

**Description:**  
This long corridor is lined with **faded portraits and crumbling archways**. The air is thick with whispers—figures in **tattered scholar robes flicker in and out of existence**, replaying their last moments before the manor fell into madness. **Candlelight shifts erratically, illuminating glimpses of the past**—a researcher frantically scribbling notes, another screaming before vanishing, and a third standing frozen in terror.

#### **👻 Encounter: Echoes of the Doomed**
- **Trigger:** If players interact with the echoes (e.g., touching them, speaking to them, or standing in their paths), they trigger **psychic disturbances**.
- **Effect:** The room **reacts to the players’ emotions**. If they display fear or hostility, the echoes **turn into vengeful wraiths (CR 3)**, attacking. If they **speak calmly or listen**, they can learn **vital secrets** about the manor’s fall, granting advantage on later Arcana checks.

#### **🎭 Unique Interactions:**
📌 _Following the Echoes:_ Players who **follow the sequence of events correctly** (Intelligence DC 15 Investigation) **unlock a hidden passage** to the **Clockwork Sanctum**.  
📌 _Mimicking the Scholars:_ If a player successfully **imitates a scholar’s actions**, they can **access hidden knowledge** (advantage on Arcana checks in future rooms).  
📌 _Absorbing an Echo:_ A player may attempt to **merge with an echo** (DC 16 Wisdom save), gaining **one of Mordenkainen’s lost spells** for a single use before it vanishes.

---

### **7 The Time-Torn Study**

**Description:**  
This study is a **patchwork of clashing timelines**. **Books hover midair, writing appears and erases itself, and a chair is both upright and shattered at the same time.** A tea cup spills, then unspills, over and over. **Phantom hands move objects as if used by people who are not there.** The air hums with residual magic.

#### **🕰️ Encounter: The Temporal Horror (CR 6)**
- **Trigger:** If players disrupt any object **caught in a time loop**, a **Temporal Horror** (a many-eyed, shifting creature that feeds on time distortions) **materializes**.
- **Effect:** The horror **rewinds players’ actions**, forcing them to **repeat their last turn** unless they succeed on **DC 15 Intelligence saves**. It also **teleports unpredictably**, phasing in and out of past and future versions of the room.

#### **🔄 Unique Interactions:**
📌 _Using Time Against It:_ Players who **observe the loops carefully** can force the Horror **to repeat its attacks on itself** (Insight DC 15).  
📌 _Rewinding an Event:_ If players **place an object back where it was before a loop began**, they **seal part of the room’s instability**, **stunning the Horror for 1 round.**  
📌 _Predicting the Future:_ By synchronizing with the timeline (Arcana DC 17), a player can **glimpse future events**, gaining **advantage on their next 3 attacks or saving throws.**

---

### **8 The Broken Greenhouse**

**Description:**  
This overgrown chamber was once a **lush botanical garden**, now **twisted and filled with monstrous flora**. **Glowing vines pulse like veins**, and the air is thick with spores that **cause brief hallucinations of forgotten memories**. Some plants appear to **whisper names**—perhaps of the lost souls absorbed into them.

#### **Encounter: The Memory-Leeching Flora**
- **Trigger:** Stepping onto the soil or **touching the vines** awakens the **Carnivorous Mindflower** (CR 5), a massive plant that **feeds on memories instead of flesh**.
- **Effect:** Players hit by the Mindflower’s tendrils must **make a DC 15 Intelligence save or forget one prepared spell, feat, or ability** for 1 minute.

#### **🧠 Unique Interactions:**
📌 _Harvesting the Flowers:_ Some plants hold **residual fragments of past minds**. If correctly **harvested** (Nature DC 14), they can **restore lost memories** or even reveal **secrets about the manor**.  
📌 _Feeding It False Memories:_ If a player **conjures an illusion or tells a fabricated story**, they can **force the plant to absorb it**, weakening its psychic attacks.  
📌 _Consuming a Psychic Fruit:_ A rare, pulsating fruit in the corner can be eaten (Arcana DC 16) to grant **temporary psychic abilities**, including **Detect Thoughts or limited precognition** for 1 hour.

---

### **9 The Hall of Sealed Doors**

**Description:**  
A long hallway filled with **dozens of locked doors, each showing glimpses of the past** when touched. Some doors reveal **Mordenkainen at his peak**, while others **show the moment he fell into madness**. The air is heavy with **distorted whispers**, urging the players to **"choose the right door."**

#### **🔑 Encounter: The False Paths**
- **Trigger:** Opening the wrong door can **trap players in a time loop** or summon **illusory nightmares** that feel real.
- **Effect:** Each incorrect door **summons a shadowy doppelgänger of the opener**, forcing them to battle a **mirror version of themselves** (CR 4).

#### **🚪 Unique Interactions:**
📌 _Finding the True Door:_ Observing the doors closely (Perception DC 17) reveals **one with Mordenkainen’s arcane sigil**—this is the true path.  
📌 _Communing with the Whispers:_ Speaking to the voices (Insight DC 15) reveals hints about which doors are **safe or deadly**.  
📌 _Marking a Door in the Past:_ If a player marks a door in the present, it **retroactively appears in past visions**, letting them see **which path they need to take**.

---

### **10. The Clockwork Sanctum**

**Description:**  
This grand chamber houses a **massive, suspended clock** at its center, with **gears turning in unnatural ways**. **Magical timepieces of all kinds float in the air**, ticking at **different speeds**. The energy here **warps reality**, sometimes making **players move in slow motion or suddenly fast-forward**.

#### **🕰️ Encounter: The Timekeeper Warden (CR 7)**
- **Trigger:** Interacting with the floating timepieces or touching the clock **awakens the Timekeeper Warden**, a **mechanical construct fused with Mordenkainen’s past regrets**.
- **Effect:** The Warden **rewinds damage it takes** every other round, **forcing players to use strategy rather than brute force.**

#### **⏳ Unique Interactions:**
📌 _Disrupting the Clock’s Flow:_ Players who **manipulate the gears correctly** (Tinkering DC 15) can **slow the Warden**, removing **its reaction ability for 2 turns**.  
📌 _Syncing with Time Magic:_ A spellcaster can **tap into the chamber’s magic** (Arcana DC 17) to **cast a free Haste or Slow spell** once per combat.  
📌 _Reversing an Unfortunate Event:_ The clock’s magic allows a **single moment to be undone**, letting the party **reroll a failed check or saving throw** once.

- Once inside, his **madness manifests as the Madness Entity**, forcing players to **fight while maintaining the ritual**.

# **Ways to Weaken the Madness Entity**

**Players can interact with the environment to weaken the entity in phases. Each action reduces the entity’s power and adds strategic depth.**

## **📖 The Library of Forbidden Tomes**

- **Trigger:** Players search through the shelves and locate Mordenkainen’s journal or a tome on **Elder Gods** (DC 15 Investigation or Arcana).
- **Effect:** Revealing the entity’s nature causes it to **lose its Reality Distortion ability** (disadvantage on ranged attacks is removed).
- **Bonus Effect:** If players **read the passage aloud** (DC 16 Intelligence or Religion), they momentarily **anchor Mordenkainen’s mind**, causing the entity to **lose its next Legendary Action.**

### **Additional Actions:**

📌 _Burning the Corrupt Tome:_ A cursed book containing **Elder God whispers** can be **destroyed in magical fire**, dealing **30 radiant damage** to the entity.  
📌 _Locating a Binding Rune:_ A rune on the floor disrupts the entity’s form. Players can **erase or reactivate it**, forcing the entity to make a **DC 18 Wisdom save** or become **stunned for 1 round**.

---

## **🔭 The Observatory of Unblinking Eyes**

- **Trigger:** Players activate the **cosmic lens**, which **reveals the Madness Entity’s true form** (DC 14 Arcana or Intelligence).
- **Effect:** The entity **cannot use invisibility, illusions, or teleportation**, making it **easier to target** and **preventing it from hiding in reality distortions.**
- **Bonus Effect:** If a player aligns the telescope **to a specific celestial body** associated with reality (e.g., a distant, stable star), they can **focus a beam of cosmic energy**, dealing **6d10 force damage** and **lowering the entity’s AC by 2.**

### **Additional Actions:**

📌 _Shattering a Corrupted Star Map:_ One of the ancient maps depicts the **Elder God’s influence** on Barovia. If destroyed, it creates an **anti-magic pulse**, **canceling one of the entity’s active spells** (such as Dominate Person or Confusion).  
📌 _Using an Ancient Astronomical Device:_ Players can **calibrate a forgotten machine** (DC 16 Investigation) to **slow time**, reducing the entity’s **movement speed by half for 2 rounds**.

---

## **🌌 The Rift Chamber (Basement Catacombs)**

- **Trigger:** Players manipulate the **unstable rift**, causing **echoes of past and future events** to surface (DC 15 Arcana).
- **Effect:** Players can **call forth a moment of clarity from Mordenkainen’s past**, weakening the entity’s connection and **reducing its hit points by 30.**
- **Bonus Effect:** If a player steps into the rift **willingly**, they can attempt to **anchor reality by reliving Mordenkainen’s memories** (DC 18 Wisdom save). Success **suppresses the Madness Aura for 3 rounds.**

### **Additional Actions:**

📌 _Collapsing Part of the Rift:_ By destabilizing the chamber’s **arcane foundation**, the entity **takes 5d10 force damage** and **loses its next Legendary Action.**  
📌 _Sealing the Rift with a Ritual:_ A player using **Identify, Arcana (DC 17), or spellcraft** can **close part of the rift**, forcing the entity to **make all attacks at disadvantage for 2 rounds.**

---

### **🌀 Additional Strategic Elements**

- **Environmental Hazards**: Time distortions cause players to **repeat actions** if they fail saves, making them vulnerable to attacks.
- **Limited Time Interactions**: Some effects require **quick decisions** (e.g., a collapsing bookcase in the Library could be pushed over to pin the entity).
- **Group Coordination**: Some actions may require **multiple players working together**, such as channeling a ritual in the Rift Chamber while others hold off the entity.
