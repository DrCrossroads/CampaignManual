- **Location**: A large, crumbling estate that sits atop a hill overlooking the city. The manor was once owned by a powerful aristocratic family, but it has been abandoned for decades after a bloody murder-suicide that wiped out the entire family in 1910.
- **Hauntings**: The wind carries strange, haunting voices from the manor, and strange lights flicker in the windows at night. Some say the family members’ spirits still roam the grounds, reenacting their final moments. The sound of a baby crying, footsteps echoing down the halls, and the eerie sound of a music box playing by itself are common occurrences.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The murder-suicide may have been part of a larger, more sinister plan involving the occult, and the estate may contain artifacts related to rituals meant to raise the dead or communicate with dark entities. The spirits are trapped in a cycle, and only by breaking the curse can the horrors be put to rest.

## Nursery Rhyme
Once there stood a house so grand,
Built by love, built by hand.
But love turned sour, and hand held blade,
Now ghosts remain where bodies laid.

A bride in white, a groom in red,
Danced all night ‘til both were dead.
They waltz, they twirl, they cry and moan,
But still they dance, all on their own.

She hums a tune, he walks the halls,
Blood still stains the crumbling walls.
A candle flickers in the night—
Leave now, before it takes your light.

Lady in white, at the window stands,
Blood on her dress, rings on her hands.
She waltzes alone when the moon is high,
Waiting for love, though none pass by.

Up on Blackstone Hill so high,
A woman laughed, a man did cry.
Blood-stained hands and echoed sighs,
Now she watches with hollow eyes.
