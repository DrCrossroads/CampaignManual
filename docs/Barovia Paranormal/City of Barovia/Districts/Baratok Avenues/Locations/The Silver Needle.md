_"A fine suit should be armor, a statement, and a weapon all at once."_

A **tailor of enchanted clothing**, The Silver Needle serves **the wealthy elite, spies, and assassins** looking for **attire that does more than impress**. The shop operates like a **high-end fashion house**, but its back room offers **clothing with supernatural properties**.

ðŸ”¹ **Description**
- A **flawlessly dressed** tailor, always in a **perfectly fitted three-piece suit**.
- His **hands are wrapped in black silk gloves**, hiding something **strange underneath**.
- His shop has **no mirrors**â€”or rather, the mirrors show **things that arenâ€™t there**.

ðŸ”¹ **How He Operates**
- Clients must be **invited**â€”walk-ins are turned away.
- He doesnâ€™t **ask how you got your money**, but he **always knows**.
- If you **betray him, your clothes betray you**â€”stitched shut at the worst time, or perhaps **moving of their own accord**.

ðŸ”¹ **What He Sells**
- **Suits that make you unnoticeable**â€”or so memorable that no one forgets you.
- **Gloves that silence gunfire**, **coats that resist knives**, **hats that let you hear whispers from across the room**.
- **A service: He can weave a "favor" into a garment**â€”but someday, the clothing will demand repayment.

ðŸ”¹ **Potential Hooks**
- A **spyâ€™s enchanted suit** was stolen, and now **their secrets are at risk**.
- A famous client of his has **vanished**, leaving behind only **their suit, still moving as if worn**.
- The tailor offers the party **an unclaimed order**, but warns **it may belong to somethingâ€¦ inhuman**.
