# The Vanished Theater

- **Location**: An old, crumbling theater that was once the hub of the city’s vaudeville scene but has been abandoned for decades. It was shut down mysteriously after a tragic fire during a performance in 1908 that left the lead actor and several audience members dead.
- **Hauntings**: Ghostly whispers of lost performances, apparitions of the burning actors, eerie flickering lights, and the occasional sound of a piano playing from within the building, though it’s been long broken. Some claim that the audience still watches shows in the spirit realm.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The building is set to be demolished, but a group of curious individuals finds a forgotten program from the night of the fire, suggesting that there were hidden secrets behind the tragic event.

## Nursery Rhyme
Curtains rise, the play’s begun,
A ghostly cast, an audience none.
Take your seat, don’t make a sound,
Come the final act, you won’t be found.

Curtains rise, the show’s begun,
They dance, they sing, they act, they run.
A fire fell, the play went wrong,
Yet still they bow—forever strong.

The curtain rose, the actors played,
The fire came, the boards decayed.
Yet every night they take the stage,
Trapped inside an endless page.

A play performed, a tragic scene,
The fire rose—a silent scream.
The crowd is gone, the seats decay,
Yet every night, come what may,
The final bow, the curtain call,
No one claps—they’re dead, one and all.

## Conspiracy Behind the Fire
### **The Cursed Performance: "The Final Requiem"**

- The night of the fire, the theater was premiering a **brand-new play**, _The Final Requiem_, written by an **unknown playwright**.
- The script was delivered **anonymously**, and despite its ominous themes of **death, resurrection, and eternal performance**, the director found it **compelling**—almost **impossible to refuse**.
- Many of the **lines in the play seemed eerily prophetic**, speaking of an audience that “**shall never leave**” and an actor who would “**burn forever in the spotlight.**”

### **The Lead Actor’s Secret**

- **Jonathan Harrow**, the lead actor, was **desperate for fame**, but he had begun to suspect that the play was more than just a script—it was a **spell**.
- **On the final night**, just before the last act, he attempted to **stop the performance**, but it was too late.
- When he stepped onto the stage, **the fire erupted spontaneously**, consuming the set, the audience, and himself.
- His last words, overheard by a surviving stagehand, were:
    
    > _"We were never meant to finish this show!"_
    

### **The Cult's Involvement**

- A **secretive occult group**, known as **The Chained Masquerade**, was behind the play.
- They believed that by **staging the perfect performance**, they could **trap souls in a state of eternal entertainment**, creating an **audience for something beyond the veil**.
- The fire was **never supposed to happen**—it was a **miscalculation**.
- Instead of binding the audience’s souls **to their intended master**, the catastrophe left them **adrift in limbo**, forever repeating their final moments.

### **The Unfinished Script**

- Somewhere in the theater, the **original script of The Final Requiem still remains**.
- It is **incomplete**, the final pages burned.
- If the players **find and finish the script**, they may be able to:
    - **Free the trapped souls** by **completing the performance** the way it was meant to be played.
    - **Summon whatever entity** was supposed to claim the audience, which might **not be pleased** that its ritual failed.
    - Discover the **hidden messages** in the script, revealing more about **The Chained Masquerade** and their **other rituals** still lingering in the city.
