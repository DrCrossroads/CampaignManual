## Descriptions
### _(The Gilded Cage, The District of Illusions)_

Lined with towering mansions, private clubs, and extravagant townhouses, **Baratok Avenues** is where the wealthy and powerful reside. However, beneath its opulent façade lies a deep rot—affluent families whisper of **cursed fortunes**, and more than one mansion has stood abandoned after a string of disappearances. The electric streetlamps here always flicker, as if fighting against a darkness that _shouldn’t_ be present.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Silver Key Club:** An exclusive gentleman’s club where the elite gather to discuss politics, business, and the occult. Some say a secret chamber beneath it hosts _forbidden rituals._
- **The Marrow House:** A grand estate that has been bought and abandoned **six times in the last decade**. Each owner vanished without a trace.
- **Baratok Theatre:** A lavish venue where actors _never break character_—some say because they can’t.

**Atmosphere:**
- Streets are eerily quiet, except for the distant sound of music from lavish parties.
- **Mannequins and statues seem to shift positions** when no one is looking.
- The rich here never speak above a whisper when discussing the supernatural. They _know better._
