## Descriptions
### _(The City’s Forgotten Graveyard, Ashes of the Past)_

Once a thriving neighborhood, **Berez** is now a ruined, **burned-out** district on the city’s southern outskirts. Its skeletal buildings stand as blackened husks, overtaken by creeping vines and murky floodwaters. **No one claims responsibility for the fire** that consumed Berez, but survivors whisper that something _in the mist_ set it ablaze. Now, only **vagrants, madmen, and desperate souls** live among the ruins, picking through ash-covered streets in search of anything of value.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Sunken Chapel:** A ruined church that sank partially into the soft river shore. Pilgrims say it still **rings its bells at night**, though no one has been inside in decades.
- **The Hanging Bridge:** A half-collapsed bridge where **bodies occasionally appear dangling** from the ruined supports. No one knows who hangs them.
- **The Black Pools:** Ponds that formed in the ruins after the fire. Some say they **reflect things that aren’t really there.**

**Atmosphere:**
- The ground is **always damp**, and the air smells of **soot and rot.**
- **There are no birds** in Berez. Only the occasional sound of _splashing footsteps_—even when no one is around.
- Those who wander here often **see loved ones** in the mist, beckoning them deeper.
