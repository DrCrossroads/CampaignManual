##### The Fallen Chapel

- **Location**: An abandoned chapel on the outskirts of the city, hidden deep in the woods, its architecture twisted and warped as though it were built in mockery of the traditional religious structures. The chapel was abandoned after a series of inexplicable deaths among the clergy. Rumors tell of a tragic event in the early 1900s, when a priest attempted to commune with the dead and opened a rift between the worlds.
- **Hauntings**: The chapel is surrounded by a strange, oppressive silence, but inside, things are different. The air is thick with an unnatural presence, and shadows seem to stretch unnaturally. Faint chanting can sometimes be heard from within, even though no one is supposed to be there. Bloodstains appear and disappear on the altar, and the church bells toll at night, even though no one is left to ring them.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The priest’s failed attempt to summon the dead caused a massive rupture in the veil between the living and the dead. Those who died during the ritual were never properly buried, and their restless spirits have begun to reawaken. There may be a way to stop the rift from expanding, but it requires a dangerous journey into the spirit realm.

## **Overview**
Nestled deep in the woods, far from the city’s bustling streets, stands the **Chapel of the Eternal Veil**, once dedicated to the Church of Eternal Light. Time and tragedy have twisted its very foundations, leaving it a forgotten place of despair and restless spirits. The structure leans at unnatural angles, its wooden beams warped and stonework cracked as though something inside is trying to push its way out. Despite being abandoned, the air inside is dense with unseen watchers, and an eerie silence blankets the surrounding forest.

### **The Chapel Grounds**

The overgrown courtyard is littered with remnants of forgotten graves, their markers shattered or buried beneath creeping vines. A rusted iron gate stands ajar, swinging slightly in a wind no one can feel. **Anyone who lingers here too long may begin to hear whispered prayers—pleas for salvation, murmured from no discernible source.**

**Investigation Mechanics:**
- **EMF Reader or Magical Detection**: Registers intermittent bursts of energy, strongest near the graves and chapel entrance.
- **Spirit Box or Communing Spells**: Detects voices whispering about a “rift” and a “failing light.”
- **Cold Spots**: Detectable near a cracked angel statue, which is warm to the touch despite the surrounding chill.

### **Main Hall (The Desecrated Nave)**

Upon stepping inside, the temperature drops abruptly. The grand hall, once a place of worship, is now a decaying ruin. The pews are overturned or broken, deep claw-like gashes marking the wooden surfaces. The floor is littered with yellowed pages from old hymn books, their words rewritten in an unrecognizable script.

**Phenomena:**
- **Chanting** can be heard echoing from the rafters, shifting between sacred hymns and something far darker.
- **Bloodstains** appear and vanish on the altar, pulsing as though still fresh.
- **Unnatural Shadows** shift and stretch, moving independently of any light source.

**Encounters:**
- **Residual Hauntings**: Spectral figures appear in the pews, mimicking a mass in progress, only to dissolve into ash when approached.
- **Echo of the Priest**: A shadowy figure with hollow eyes stands at the pulpit, its voice distorting into an inhuman wail before vanishing.

**Investigation Mechanics:**
- **UV Light or Arcane Sight**: Reveals claw marks leading toward the altar, as if something had been dragged.
- **EVP or Psychic Probing**: Captures phrases like “we opened the door” and “it waits below.”

### **The Sacristy (Priest’s Study)**

A small adjoining room filled with dust-covered books and decayed vestments. A tattered journal lies on the desk, its final entries detailing the priest’s obsession with piercing the veil to speak to lost souls. The last pages are written in erratic, frenzied script:

_"The voices are clearer now. They beckon me forward. The Eternal Light dims, but the way is open…"_

**Phenomena:**
- **Objects Move on Their Own**: Candles flicker violently, books fall from shelves, and drawers open without cause.
- **Scratching from the Walls**: Something behind the wood seems to be clawing its way out.

**Investigation Mechanics:**
- **Scrying or Aura Reading**: Reveals a glimpse of the past—the priest conducting a forbidden ritual before being violently dragged away.
- **Salt or Protective Wards**: Flickers in and out of effectiveness, suggesting something is actively resisting banishment.

### **The Bell Tower (The Calling)**

A narrow spiral staircase leads up to the bell tower, where the massive bronze bell looms overhead. The air is suffocating, heavy with unspoken dread. The bell, though rusted in place, sometimes **rings on its own**, its deep toll echoing unnaturally through the chapel.

**Phenomena:**
- **Vertigo and Dizziness**: Those who ascend feel an unnatural pull toward the open windows, as if something is urging them to jump.
- **Apparitions**: The translucent form of a cloaked figure stands by the bell, whispering to unseen entities.

**Encounters:**
- **Possession Attempt**: The spirit here tries to influence intruders, urging them toward the open air. A strong enough will can resist, but weaker minds may find themselves stepping dangerously close to the edge.
- **The Bell's Curse**: If rung, the sound forces an unstable connection with the other side, briefly summoning lost souls—some pleading for help, others seeking vengeance.

**Investigation Mechanics:**
- **Sound Recording Devices or Arcane Listening**: Capture distorted voices that grow clearer near the bell.
- **Holy Symbols or Wards**: Burn hot in the presence of the unseen force tethered here.

### **The Crypt Below (The Rift’s Origin)**

A secret passage beneath the altar leads to a hidden crypt where the ritual was performed. The walls are covered in **faded sigils**, originally meant to seal something away. Many are now **broken or defaced**, leaving the rift unstable.

**Phenomena:**
- **The Rift Itself**: A jagged tear in reality flickers in the center of the room, releasing waves of oppressive energy.
- **Whispers of the Dead**: A constant, unintelligible murmur fills the space, growing louder near the rift.

**Encounters:**
- **Lost Souls**: Spirits wander aimlessly, flickering in and out of existence. Some lash out in confusion and pain.
- **The Priest’s Revenant**: His tormented spirit is bound here, half-consumed by the rift. He attacks intruders, believing them to be the final step in completing his work.

**Investigation Mechanics:**
- **Ritual or Banishing Spells**: Can be used to weaken the rift, but doing so may anger the spirits.
- **Psychic Reading or Touching Objects**: Reveals the horrific moment when the priest’s ritual failed, condemning all present to undeath.

### **Resolution Possibilities**

1. **Seal the Rift**: Performing the correct ritual (after uncovering clues throughout the chapel) can sever the connection, putting the spirits to rest.
2. **Destroy the Rift**: Using extreme measures—such as collapsing the crypt—may remove the threat at the cost of making the chapel even more dangerous.
3. **Leave It Be**: If left unchecked, the rift could expand, causing further disturbances and potential outbreaks of hauntings across the city.
