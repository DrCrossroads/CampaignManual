> Through the fog you see the empty shell an old stone church, north of which is a cemetery of leaning  gravestones enclosed by a disintegrating iron fence.

Characters who explore the gutted church find the charred remains of a pulpit and an old iron bell cracked on the floor, lying amid the remains of a collapsed steeple.

This is where [[Father Moriarty]] does his business.
