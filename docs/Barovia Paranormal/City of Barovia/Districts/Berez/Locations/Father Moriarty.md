Runs his business from within the [[Churchyard Ruins]].

_"The Lord has forsaken me, but I still deal in His wonders."_

Once a respected priest, **Father Patrick Moriarty** was **defrocked for heresy** when he began **collecting and selling stolen holy relics**. Now, he operates out of the **catacombs beneath a ruined church**, dealing in **forbidden texts, relics of saints, and stolen miracles**.

ðŸ”¹ **Description**

- A **gaunt man in tattered priest robes**, always carrying a **silver flask of whiskey**.
- His left eye is **milky white**, supposedly due to an angelâ€™s curse.
- Smells of **incense, blood, and old books**.

ðŸ”¹ **How He Operates**

- You donâ€™t **find** Father Moriartyâ€”he finds **you**, usually in the dead of night or when you need him most.
- His **"shop"** is a hidden chamber in the ruined church, lit by candlelight and lined with **stolen holy artifacts**.
- He doesnâ€™t ask for **money**â€”he asks for **favors, secrets, or prayers**.

ðŸ”¹ **What He Sells**

- **Relics of saints**â€”some genuine, some cursed.
- **Ancient Bibles and forbidden texts**â€”inked in **gold, blood, or something darker**.
- **Holy water that burns like acid**, **crosses that ward off eldritch horrors**, and **chalices that turn water to wine (or blood, if misused).**

ðŸ”¹ **Potential Hooks**

- A **rival faction wants him dead**, and he hires the party as protection.
- A relic he sold **grants visions of an eldritch god**, and now a cult wants it back.
- He offers the party **a stolen artifact**â€”but its original owner is **a vengeful angel**.
