## Nursery Rhyme
Hush, hush, hear them sigh
In the ash where secrets lie.
They whisper still, they hum, they weep,
Begging truth that none may keep.

Burned to cinders, lost to time,
Yet voices murmur, low in rhyme.
Step too near and you will hear,
The truth they whisper—oh so clear.

Smoke still lingers, cinders speak,
Ashes whisper, voices weak.
The town is gone, but something stays,
Calling, pulling, through the haze.
Listen close and you will learn,
Why Berez was left to burn.

Burned to cinders, lost to time,
Yet voices murmur, low in rhyme.
Step too near and you will hear,
The truth they whisper—oh so clear.

## **The Burning of Berez: A City Erased from History**

Berez was once **a thriving riverside district**, a place of **wealth, corruption, and dangerous knowledge.** It was home to **crime bosses, scholars, and radicals**—the kind of people who dug too deep, asked the wrong questions, and made the wrong enemies.

At its heart stood **Ulrich Mansion**, the home of **Leopold Ulrich**, a man of power, influence, and an insatiable **desire to uncover forbidden truths.**

But **Berez is gone now.**  
**Burned to the ground.**  
**Wiped from the city’s records.**  
And no one speaks of it.

Because **Ulrich discovered the truth.**

## **The Forbidden Knowledge of Leopold Ulrich**

Leopold Ulrich was a **financier, a scholar, and a ruthless opportunist.** He had dealings with the mafia, the clergy, and even whispers of **occult societies.** But his greatest curiosity—**his fatal mistake**—was investigating **Strahd von Zarovich.**

- **Ulrich wasn’t content with rumors.** He bribed scholars, **hired spies**, and even uncovered **ancient records** that predated the city itself.
- He learned that **Strahd was no mere vampire.**
- He learned that **Strahd’s immortality was not just a curse—but a prison.**

The **Elder God slumbering beneath the city** required **an anchor**, a **sacrifice that must endure for eternity.** Strahd was that sacrifice—a **warden bound by blood and shadow.**

But the cycle was **not eternal.** It could be **ended**—or worse, **reset.**

Ulrich’s final discovery:

- **Strahd does not want to rule.** He wants **to die.**
- If the cycle ends, **the Elder God will wake.**
- If the cycle resets, **another will take Strahd’s place.**
- But there is **a third option—one Ulrich died before uncovering.**

## **The Night Berez Burned**

The night before Berez burned, **Ulrich sent a desperate message.**

- He reached out to **a secret faction**—rebels, scholars, or possibly even the Silver Order.
- He tried to **expose Strahd**, believing he could **destroy him** and end the nightmare.
- **But Strahd came first.**

**Berez was purged.**

- **Strahd’s enforcers set fire to the district.**
- **The river ran black with ash and bodies.**
- **Every building, every record, every whisper of Ulrich’s truth was erased.**

And Ulrich?

- **No one knows what happened to him.**
- Some say he burned with his mansion.
- Some say **Strahd took him to his skyscraper** for a fate worse than death.
- Some say **he still lingers**, somewhere beneath the ruins, watching, waiting…

## **End the Cycle or Reset It?**

Berez serves as a **warning** and a **choice.**

The **players now know** that Strahd’s reign is **not just tyranny—it is a containment.**

They can:

1. **Destroy Strahd** and risk **releasing the Elder God.**
2. **Find a new ruler**, condemning someone else to an eternity of torment.
3. **Seek the Third Option**—a path that even Ulrich never uncovered.

And if they **look too closely**…  
They might end up just like **Ulrich.**
