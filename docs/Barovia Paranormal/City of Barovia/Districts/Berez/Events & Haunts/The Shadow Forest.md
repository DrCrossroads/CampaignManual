- **Location**: A dense, overgrown forest that borders the city on all sides, believed to be cursed and full of secrets. The locals avoid it, especially after dusk. Strange lights are often seen flickering between the trees, and the air carries an unnerving chill, even on the warmest days. Some say the forest was once the site of forbidden rituals by settlers who sought to harness the power of ancient entities.
- **Hauntings**: Ghostly figures wander between the trees, with faces contorted in terror, beckoning the living to join them. Some claim to hear the sound of a distant, sorrowful woman crying in the dark, as if pleading for help. Shadows seem to move with an unnatural purpose, and there’s a thick fog that appears without warning, swallowing travelers. The spirits here are tied to the land’s dark history, and they’re growing restless.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The forest is a gateway to a forgotten realm, where ancient spirits and monstrous creatures are waiting to break through into the world of the living. Certain objects, like an old stone idol or a cursed heirloom, may be linked to the disturbance. Investigating the source of the haunting could reveal a dark secret about the city’s founders and their connection to the forest.

## Nursery Rhyme
Into the mist, into the trees,
You’ll never leave, so beg and plead.
The shadows dance, they pull, they leer,
You’ll never leave, so stay right here.

The mist rolls thick, the path is gone,
The trees stand tall, they pull you on.
A thousand faces in the bark,
Staring, silent, cold, and dark.

Step too far, step too deep,
Something stirs where shadows creep.
Fog rolls thick and fingers claw,
They see, they wait, they watch in awe.
No path leads out, though paths lead in,
The forest takes—enter and never leave again.

Into the mist, into the trees,
You’ll never leave, so beg and plead.
The shadows dance, they pull, they leer,
You’ll never leave, so stay right here.
