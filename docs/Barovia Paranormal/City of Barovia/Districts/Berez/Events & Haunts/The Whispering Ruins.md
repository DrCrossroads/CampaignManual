This event occurs as players wander the ruins. They hear **whispers**, first a low murmur, but voices grow to a tumultuous cacophony, repeating their final words before the fire.
- Some ghosts **are trapped in time**, reliving the moment the fires consumed them.
- If the players listen closely, they hear:
    - **"Ulrich knew… he KNEW… and they came for him."**
    - **"There was another way… another way…"**
    - **"Strahd did not do this alone. The Church… the Church helped."**
