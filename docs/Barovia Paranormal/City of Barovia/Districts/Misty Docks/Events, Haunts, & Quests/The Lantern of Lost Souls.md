## Nursery Rhyme
A glow ahead, a path so clear,
A gentle voice that soothes your fear.
He walks alone, he walks so far,
A father lost, a guiding star.
Yet in the glass, a twisted grin—
The light is not what burns within.

#### **Background**

This haunt centers on a tragic figure—a man cursed by a phantom who manipulates him into committing unspeakable acts in a desperate attempt to bring his lost daughter back to life. The man is unknowingly used as a pawn by the very entity that tricked him, and the lantern he carries is the key to both his misery and the phantom’s dark return.

The lantern, once an innocuous object used to light the path during the dark nights, has become a twisted symbol of grief and malevolence. The man is haunted by the ghost of his daughter, who he believes is inside the lantern, and he will go to any lengths to see her return. The phantom, hidden within the lantern, manipulates his every move, feeding on his despair and further entangling him in a web of murder and madness.

#### **Haunting Description**

The man, middle-aged and gaunt, walks endlessly through the area where the haunt takes place—whether it’s an abandoned house, a forest clearing, or a city alleyway. He clutches a brass lantern with a faintly flickering light. His eyes are hollow, filled with sorrow and desperate hope, as he speaks to the phantom he believes is his daughter. He mutters to himself constantly, making fragmented comments about the ritual he must complete.

Everywhere he goes, the faint smell of smoke and burnt oil lingers. When the lantern’s light shines, it flickers unnaturally, as if the flame inside is desperately struggling to stay alive. Despite the occasional flickering, the light never fully dies, and the man constantly adjusts the lamp’s wick to keep it burning.

The man moves slowly, almost mechanically, following the orders whispered by the phantom. He occasionally speaks to those nearby, pleading for their help in completing the ritual, though he’s often lost in his own thoughts, unaware of his surroundings. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the lantern is no mere object—it’s the vessel for the powerful phantom’s soul.

#### **Key Locations/Areas**

- **The Forgotten House** – The haunt occurs in an abandoned building, hidden in a secluded area. The house has been untouched for years, its walls decaying, and the air thick with dust and a sense of overwhelming grief.
    - In the upstairs room, remnants of the ritual can be found—drawings of a woman (the daughter) etched into the walls, a partially prepared corpse (the body for the daughter), and other disturbing remnants of the man’s twisted obsession.
- **The Ritual Circle** – A dark corner where the man has begun preparing the body for his daughter. Strange symbols are scrawled in blood, and ritual tools are scattered about. At the center of the circle is the empty body, awaiting the final steps of the unholy ritual.

#### **Paranormal Phenomena**

- **The Flickering Lantern** – The lantern’s light flickers unnaturally, growing dimmer or brighter in response to the characters’ actions or the proximity of the phantom’s influence. If the lantern is kept stoked, it flickers brightly; if left unattended, it begins to dim rapidly, and an eerie wind causes the flame to dance wildly.
- **Whispers and Commands** – The man constantly hears the phantom’s whispers in his ear, giving him orders on how to proceed. These whispers are often indecipherable to others but can be heard faintly by the players if they are close. As they listen, they will realize the phantom is directing him to kill and prepare the body.
- **The Illusion of His Daughter** – Occasionally, the man will hold the lantern up to the players, and for a brief moment, they will see the flickering image of a child’s face inside the lantern’s glow. This image vanishes as quickly as it appears, leaving the man to mutter in confusion.
- **Ghostly Encounters** – The man is often haunted by apparitions of his daughter, appearing at night to ask for help or beg for her resurrection. The spectral girl sometimes seems real, with flesh, voice, and emotion, only for her to fade out of existence once someone attempts to interact with her.
- **Unholy Rituals** – The man occasionally begins to prepare the ritual in front of the players. He may gather items or prepare a space for the body, thinking that these actions will bring his daughter back. This will give the players the chance to intervene, but the closer they get to disrupting the ritual, the more aggressive the phantom becomes.
    

#### **Key Encounters**

1. **The Man’s Plea** – The players encounter the man while he’s searching for “ingredients” for his ritual. He is desperate for help and believes the characters are the answer to restoring his daughter. He will ask them to assist him in collecting items or even offer them the corpse he’s begun preparing, believing it is needed for the resurrection. If the players refuse, he may grow hostile, believing they are standing in the way of his daughter’s return.
    - **Tactics**: If pressured, the man will fight to protect the lantern, unaware of its true nature.
    - **Resolution**: If the players help, they may be unwittingly helping complete the ritual.
2. **Confronting the Phantom** – Eventually, the players will realize that the phantom is not the daughter but a malevolent spirit trapped in the lantern. The man may be convinced to shatter the lantern in a moment of clarity, but the phantom will try to prevent this at all costs. The phantom can project terrifying illusions or manipulate the man’s grief to make the players seem like enemies.
    - **Combat**: If a confrontation with the phantom happens, it will not take physical form but instead use its influence over the man and the surroundings. The players may need to break the lantern to sever its hold.
3. **The Lantern’s Breaking** – If the lantern is broken, the man’s daughter will briefly appear the following morning, but not as she was. She will be a tormented spirit, half-alive, screaming and begging for release. Her appearance marks the end of the haunt and the completion of her tragic story.
    - **Final Act**: The players may need to help the spirit pass on, freeing her from the phantom’s control. The man, too, is freed from the curse of his obsession, but the damage done to him is permanent. His sanity shattered, he will wander the world, never finding peace.

#### **Possible Plot Hooks**

- **The Curse of the Lantern**: If players learn of the man’s tragic story from other survivors or an old acquaintance, they may be able to track him down and end the haunting before more lives are lost.
- **The Phantom’s True Nature**: The more the players investigate, the more they realize that the daughter’s spirit was never in the lantern, and that the phantom’s true goal is to use the man’s grief to fuel its return to the physical world.
- **The Unholy Ritual**: As the man performs the ritual to bring his daughter back, players may find themselves in a race against time to prevent the final step of the unholy resurrection.

### **Conclusion**

The haunt is a tragic tale of manipulation, grief, and the darkness of obsession. Whether the players help or hinder the man’s progress, they are drawn into a web of lies and torment. If they break the lantern, they release the man from his curse, but the consequences of the phantom’s manipulation may not be easily undone.
