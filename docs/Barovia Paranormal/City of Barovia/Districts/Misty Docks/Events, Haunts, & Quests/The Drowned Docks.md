- **Location**: A stretch of old docks that have long since fallen into disrepair, located on the edge of the bay. The wooden planks creak beneath the weight of the few boats that still dock there. A thick, impenetrable fog often rolls in from the sea, swallowing the area in a murky blanket, making it hard to see more than a few feet in any direction.
- **Hauntings**: The air is thick with the smell of brine and decay, and the water beneath the docks seems unnaturally still, as though it’s holding something just below the surface. Fishermen who worked here in the past report seeing strange lights drifting on the water at night, and the sound of footsteps or low voices echo from the fog, though no one is in sight. Some claim to have seen shadowy figures emerging from the mist, walking slowly towards the water, their faces obscured but their eyes glowing faintly.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The docks were once the site of a long-forgotten trade in illicit goods, many of which were connected to the occult and dark rituals. Now, the restless spirits of sailors lost at sea, as well as those who were sacrificed to unknown forces, haunt the area. Investigating the docks might uncover the details of these rituals—and perhaps lead to a terrifying discovery about what lurks beneath the water.

## Nursery Rhyme
Fog that clings, waves that call,
A whisper low, a ship so tall.
Step aboard, oh foolish kin,
For once you do, you won’t leave again.

The tide rolls in, the tide rolls out,
But some are left to roam about.
The lantern sways, the ropes still creak,
A hundred hands reach from the deep.
Step too close and hear them call—
The sea won’t let you leave at all.

The waves will rise, the ropes will creak,
The drowned ones sing, the lost ones speak.
They call to you, so cold, so deep,
A lullaby that pulls to sleep.
