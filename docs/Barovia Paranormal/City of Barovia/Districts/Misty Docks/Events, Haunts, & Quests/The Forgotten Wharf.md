- **Location**: A fog-choked pier on the city’s edge, abandoned by most shipping companies due to its reputation for supernatural occurrences. The once-bustling docks now only see occasional, eerie ships, often carrying no cargo but leaving behind a trail of ghostly mist and strange, unearthly sounds.
- **Hauntings**: The eerie, constant fog that surrounds the docks seems to have a mind of its own. Ghost ships have been sighted moving through the mist, with crew members that appear half-formed, translucent, or not human at all. Sometimes, the ship’s bell tolls, even when there’s no ship in sight. Oddly, some of the ships’ cargo seems to vanish, and those who work at the docks claim that items disappear only to reappear later, drenched in saltwater and unrecognizable.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: An old journal from a long-dead captain speaks of a cursed treasure—an artifact taken from a forgotten city at sea. This artifact may be the key to the strange apparitions, and some believe it’s slowly drawing all the lost souls of the drowned sailors into the city.

## Nursery Rhyme
Through mist and time the lantern glows,
A ship comes near, but no one rows.
Step aboard, don’t be afraid,
The crew is dead, but dues are paid.

The docks still stand, the ropes still creak,
The lost still whisper as they seek.
A name is called, it isn’t yours,
And yet you turn—forevermore.

Fog on the water, thick as sin,
Shapes move, they call you in.
A shadow waves, a voice says "stay,"
The path you took has slipped away.
The pier is long, the night is deep,
The fog decides what it will keep.
