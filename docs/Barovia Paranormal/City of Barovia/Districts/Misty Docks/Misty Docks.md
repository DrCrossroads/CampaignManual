### The Trades

Once the lifeblood of Barovia City’s maritime trade, the **Misty Docks** have long since fallen into disrepair. The air here is thick with the smell of brine, mildew, and rotting wood, as the fog rolls in so densely at night that entire ships vanish into the gray abyss. Cracked cobblestone streets lead past sagging warehouses, abandoned shipyards, and half-sunken vessels that groan against their moorings. Shady figures lurk in alleyways—smugglers, vagrants, and desperate men willing to do anything to survive.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Hollow Lantern:** A once-grand lighthouse, now defunct. Rumors say something _lives_ inside, guiding only those it wishes to safety.
- **The Fogbell:** A massive bell that rings on its own when the mist is thickest—usually when ships are about to vanish.
- **The Smuggler’s Way:** A labyrinth of underground tunnels used by bootleggers and cultists alike.

**Atmosphere:**
- The air is damp, the streets always seem slick with seawater or something more sinister.
- Footsteps echo strangely in the mist, and figures appear and disappear like phantoms.
- Stray lanterns flicker as if struggling to stay lit against the damp, often revealing hooded figures watching from afar.
