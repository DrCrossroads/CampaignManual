At the south end of the hilltop is a sickly copse, a grove of dead trees and shrubs with a huge, misshapen tree at its core. Blood oozes like sap from its twisted trunk. Skulking around the tree are six gangly humanoid creatures covered with needles. Embedded in the tree is a shiny battleaxe, beneath which lies a humanoid skeleton.

The tree is a Gulthias tree (see the blights entry in the Monster Manual), the roots of which extend deep be neath the hill. Lurking among the dead trees and shrubs are three vine blights, six needle blights, and twelve twig blights.The needle blights are plainly visible, but the False Appearance feature of the vine blights and the twig blights allows them to hide in plain sight. The blights attack anyone who harms the Gulthias tree, which has no actions or effective attacks of its own.
The Gulthias tree has AC 15, 250 hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage. If it is reduced to O hit points, it seems to be destroyed but isn't truly dead; it regains 1 hit point every month until it is fully healed. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check, a character can determine that the en tire stump must be uprooted for the tree to truly die. The Gulthias tree withers and dies in 3d10 days if a hallow spell is cast in its area.
The Gulthias tree creates blights from ordinary plants and is the only tree of its kind in Barovia. If the Gulthias tree is killed, no new blights can be created within Strahd's domain. Award the party 1,500 XP for destroy ing the Gulthias tree.
The skeleton lying at the base of the Gulthias tree is all that remains of a human adventurer who was killed by blights while trying to cut down the tree.

#### TREASURE
The dead adventurer's tattered leather armor isn't sal vageable, but the axe embedded in the tree is a magic battleaxe. Its handle is carved with leaves and vines, and the weapon weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra ld8 slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 pierc ing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.

#### FORTUNES OF RAVENLOFT .
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's buried amid the roots of the Gulthias tree, beneath the skeleton of the dead adventurer. Characters who dig in the ground under the skeleton automatically find it.


## The Gulthias Tree Puzzle: The Root of Secrets

### **Setup:**

The tree is massive, dark-barked, and weeping a thin crimson sap. At its base, large **gnarled roots wrap around a sealed stone slab**, flush with the ground. Four **knot-hollows** exist at the cardinal points around the tree. Each hollow has faint etchings in an ancient void-touched dialect (Void Speech, Deep Speech, or even an invented glyph system).

**Tree Lore Clues:**
- A DC 15 Arcana or Religion check reveals the tree grew from a **vampiric stake left in a void-corrupted heart**, and that its roots feed on blood and memory.
- A DC 17 Investigation check notices **four runes on the bark**, aligned to the cardinal directions, which correspond to emotional states (Joy, Rage, Grief, and Fear).

### **Puzzle Mechanic – "Feed the Tree":**

The tree only opens when it is offered four specific **emotions bound to memory**, one at each cardinal hollow. These must be triggered through:

- **Roleplay or item sacrifice** that embodies the emotion.
- **Spells** such as _calm emotions_, _phantasmal force_, or _major image_ to "trick" the tree.
- Or by speaking a memory into the bark (like _Speak with Plants_ or _Message_).

Each knot-hole responds differently when offered the correct type of memory.

|Direction|Emotion|Offering Example|Tree’s Reaction|
|---|---|---|---|
|North|Fear|A tale of trauma or a relic tied to death (e.g., a sibling’s charm from a lost battle).|Sap weeps black, then recedes.|
|East|Joy|A memory of first love, laughter, or music. A bard’s inspiration die also works.|A faint chime rings in the hollow.|
|South|Rage|Destruction of a personal item or reliving a betrayal.|The roots tremble.|
|West|Grief|A letter to the dead, spoken eulogy, or parting token.|Mist coils into the roots.|

Once all four are completed, the **roots unwind**, revealing the **stone seal**, which opens with a slow, grinding sigh, revealing a **narrow staircase spiraling into darkness**.

## Dungeon: _The Heart Below_

**Theme:** A buried temple repurposed as a **containment site for Void experiments**—long forgotten.

**Atmosphere:** Fungal growth glows faintly. Gravity feels slightly off. Whispers echo. Paranormal events are frequent. The air smells like damp earth and old blood.

### **Dungeon Layout: 4 Key Chambers + 1 Final Seal Room**

---

### Room 1: **The Scriptorium of Lies**

- Walls covered in ancient, twitching script that rearranges itself.
- An ethereal scholar’s ghost offers "answers" to any question—but each answer is **only half true**, twisted.
- DC 15 Insight or Arcana reveals the texts are _mimic-paintings_ of language—**predatory sentient script**.
- One scroll mentions Ireena as **“She-Who-Was-Promised-to-the-Stars”**.

**Paranormal Event:** A character sees themselves enter the room from the opposite direction.

---

### Room 2: **The Eye Pool**

- A still, mirror-like pool that reflects people _as they might become_ if corrupted by the void.
- Staring into the pool triggers **visions of a possible future**, offering insight, but requires a DC 14 Wis save or the character gains a short-term madness effect.
- Beneath the pool is a **whispering tendril of the Elder God**, watching.

**Clue:** A glimpse of **Strahd** with Ireena, both transformed into voidspawn.

---

### Room 3: **The Feeding Chamber**

- An altar with a heart-shaped depression. The room smells of iron and fungus.
- Placing a **blood sacrifice** (1 HP or a blood-covered item) opens a passage.
- A voice murmurs: _“The blood must echo the yearning.”_

**Hidden Lore:** The altar is connected to the **origin of the Gulthias Tree**—grown from a **void-altered vampire’s heart**, used in dark rituals centuries ago.

---

### Room 4: **The Archive of Unspoken Things**

- A vault of **living memories**, stored as suspended, floating droplets of black water.
- Interacting with the droplets shows vivid flashbacks: failed rituals, cults worshipping “She Beyond the Veil,” and early attempts to corrupt Strahd.

**Major Reveal:**  
One memory shows **Elias Harroway** writing in a glowing book, watching the characters from the past as they explore. He looks directly at the viewer and says:

> "You've come farther than most. But the story has only just begun."

---

### Final Room: **The Root Core**

- A pulsing organic chamber connected to the Gulthias Tree’s roots.
- A large, petrified **void-egg** rests here, cracked and dormant.
- An unfinished ritual circle surrounds it—clearly meant to **merge a vampire with void essence**.

**Paranormal Finale Event:**

- **Ireena’s voice echoes**, despite her not being present. She says: _“I dreamed of this place. I screamed beneath its roots.”_
- If the players take anything or damage the egg, the tree above groans, and the roots begin to pulse with crimson light.

**Optional Combat Encounter:**

- A corrupted former vampire (possibly even **a prototype of Strahd**) stirs from a side wall. CR 5–7 guardian with void powers.

---

## Rewards and Clues:

- Void-tainted relic: _Whispering Fang_ (dagger that whispers secrets for advantage on Insight once per day).
- Clues to Ireena’s role and how **Strahd is being manipulated**.
- A sigil that can temporarily **seal a Voidspawn or delay a turning ritual**—usable once.
