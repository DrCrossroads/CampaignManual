_"For the discerning buyer, the right price is never too high."_

A **private auction house** catering to the elite, Vance & Keller Curiosities is where the cityâ€™s most powerful figuresâ€”both human and otherwiseâ€”bid on rare and **often dangerous** artifacts. The auctions are held at **ever-changing locations**, with invitations sent only to **verified bidders**. The prices are exorbitant, but the merchandise is genuine.

ðŸ”¹ **Owners**
- **Randolph Vance** â€“ A former museum curator with a **sharp wit and a colder heart**. He ensures every item is legitimate and knows more about the city's hidden relics than most scholars.
- **Elias Keller** â€“ A well-dressed, soft-spoken man with **unnerving eyes** and **an unknown past**. Some claim he isn't human, but no one dares to ask.

ðŸ”¹ **How They Operate**
- Auctions are **invitation-only**, often held in abandoned mansions, hidden theaters, or underground speakeasies.
- Security is **intense**â€”armed guards, arcane wards, and unseen forces watching from the shadows.
- Some **bidders are not human**â€”cult leaders, supernatural entities, and masked individuals who never show their faces.
- If you try to steal from them, **you disappear**â€”or worse, youâ€™re sold at the next auction.

ðŸ”¹ **What They Sell**
- **Cursed relics**, lost grimoires, and occult artifacts.
- **Black-market firearms** with mysterious modifications.
- **Strange antiques**â€”some of which still whisper or bleed.

ðŸ”¹ **Potential Hooks**
- The party is hired to **retrieve a stolen item before itâ€™s auctioned off**.
- They must **outbid a cult leader** for a relic before it falls into the wrong hands.
- An item they bought **has a hidden secret**, and someone (or something) wants it back.
