##### The Whispering Libarary

- **Location**: An ancient library tucked away on a quiet side street. The library is home to rare and forbidden books, many of which are kept locked away in an old wing that no one dares to visit. The library has been slowly decaying, but the books are well-preserved despite the state of the building itself.
- **Hauntings**: The books seem to have a life of their own. The whispers of the texts are faintly audible when the library is quiet, and some books are said to contain knowledge that can drive a reader mad. Certain passages glow faintly in the dark, and those who open the wrong book may find themselves inexplicably drawn into the stories or visions within. The librarian is a mysterious figure, and some suspect that they are not entirely human, perhaps a spirit bound to the library for eternity.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: One of the books, known as the _Tome of Lost Knowledge_, is said to hold the key to unlocking the supernatural forces plaguing the city. But reading it might open a doorway to a dangerous world, and its influence may begin to affect the minds of those who come into contact with it.

## Nursery Rhyme
Turn the page, the letters crawl,
The books don’t like your hands at all.
A whispered word, a flickering light,
A story pulls, it grips too tight.
Read too long, you’ll see the sign—
The tale you hold is now your line.

Hush, hush, the books do talk,
Their voices whisper, pages walk.
Read too deep, look too long,
And you’ll be bound where words belong.
