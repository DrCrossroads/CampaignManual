##### The Lighthouse of the Lost Mariner

- **Location**: A decaying lighthouse on a barren stretch of coastline, isolated and hidden by thick, salt-laden winds. The lighthouse has not been operational for decades, but the light still sometimes flickers at night, visible from miles away. It stands on a craggy cliff, with the turbulent sea crashing below, and its beacon serves as a strange, haunting presence in the night.
- **Hauntings**: The lighthouse keeper, long dead, is said to still walk the tower at night, endlessly guiding ships away from the dangerous rocks. The lighthouse itself seems to have a strange magnetic pull, drawing people toward it despite the perilous cliffs and rough seas. Some say the light is not of this world, flickering with an unnatural glow that lures the unwary into the water, where they drown. Others report hearing the ringing of a foghorn at night, only to find that it never comes from the lighthouse but from the surrounding cliffs.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The lighthouse keeper was once a mariner who made a terrible deal with an ancient sea spirit, promising to guide ships for eternity in exchange for his soul. But now, the keeper’s spirit is bound to the light, and it is said that the spirit can only be freed if the original pact is broken. However, doing so may involve confronting the sea spirit itself—and the secrets it holds.

## Nursery Rhyme
The light still burns, the waves still roar,
The keeper stands upon the shore.
One ship is saved, one meets its doom,
He never knows which fate to choose.
Bound in pact and drowned in woe,
The sea won't let him let them go.

## **Overview**

Perched on the edge of a desolate, wind-scoured cliff, the decaying lighthouse stands as a silent guardian against the wrath of the sea. Its once-proud beacon has long since fallen into disrepair, yet, against all logic, the light still flickers to life on certain nights, casting its eerie glow across the turbulent waters. No one has tended to the lighthouse for decades, yet the spectral figure of the old lighthouse keeper is often seen pacing the upper levels, forever carrying out his duty to guide ships away from the treacherous rocks below.

Some say the lighthouse has a pull—**a magnetic force** that lures wanderers toward it, drawing them inexorably closer, regardless of their will. Sailors tell stories of a phantom foghorn echoing along the cliffs, sounding warnings that do not come from the lighthouse itself. And in the dead of night, some claim to see ghostly ships drifting through the mist—ships that never reach shore, their spectral passengers forever lost at sea.

It is whispered that the lighthouse keeper was once a mariner who struck a **terrible bargain** with an ancient sea spirit, binding himself to the lighthouse in exchange for his soul. Now, he is **trapped**, unable to move on, his spectral presence forever tied to the beacon that still shines against the storm.

## **Key Locations & Descriptions**

##### **1. The Cliffside Approach**

- The lighthouse stands **atop a jagged cliff**, the only access being a crumbling, narrow path winding up the rocky coastline.
- The sea below is **violent and unforgiving**, waves crashing against the black rocks with eerie intensity.
- Those who approach may feel an **unseen force** pulling them toward the tower, almost as if the wind itself is whispering their names.
- Strange **marks are etched into the cliffside**, old nautical symbols warning against trespassing.
- A rusted bell, hanging from a wooden frame, sways in the wind but does not ring. Some say it rings only when a soul is about to be claimed by the sea.

##### **2. The Lighthouse Exterior**

- The structure is **weather-beaten and cracked**, with deep grooves from years of relentless salt and wind.
- The **main door is chained shut**, yet those who step too close hear faint knocking from the other side.
- Windows are either **shattered or fogged**, obscuring the view inside. Occasionally, a flickering shadow moves behind the glass.
- The lighthouse is **taller than it should be**, seeming to loom higher than physics should allow, especially when viewed from a distance.

##### **3. The Keeper’s Quarters** _(Ground Floor)_

- A dusty, decrepit room with **a single bed**, a wooden desk, and an oil lamp that still flickers despite the lack of fuel.

- An old coat and hat still hang by the door, eerily **untouched by time**.
- A **rotted trapdoor** leads to a basement, though the wood seems recently disturbed, as if something has passed through.

- The **iron steps groan underfoot**, but there is no echo—only an unnatural silence.
- Every few steps, **the temperature drops suddenly**, breath turning visible.

##### **5. The Lantern Room** _(Top Floor)_

- The great **beacon still burns**, but its light pulses unnaturally, shifting between warm gold and **a sickly, otherworldly blue**.

##### **6. The Hidden Chamber** _(Below the Lighthouse)_
