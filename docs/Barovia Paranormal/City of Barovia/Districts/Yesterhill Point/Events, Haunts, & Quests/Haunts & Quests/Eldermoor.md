##### The Phantom Vessel

- **Location**: A rusted, decaying vessel docked at the city’s long-abandoned port. The ship once belonged to a wealthy shipping magnate who mysteriously disappeared at sea in the late 1800s. Now the ship is thought to be haunted, but no one dares to go near it.
- **Hauntings**: Crew members' spirits appear on deck, replaying their final moments on the ship before it sank. The ship is said to float in and out of reality, and strange weather patterns form around it. Sometimes, when the fog rolls in, it seems as though the ship has vanished altogether.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: Rumors circulate that the ghost ship is a prison for the souls of those who were involved in a treacherous betrayal, and that the treasure it was carrying was cursed. A group of adventurers may uncover secrets or find themselves trapped on board.

## **Overview**

At the edge of the city’s **long-abandoned port**, a rusted ship sits in the water, **silent and still**, yet **eerily untouched by time**. Known as the **"Eldermoor"**, the ship belonged to **Victor Hargrave**, a wealthy shipping magnate who mysteriously **disappeared at sea** in the late 1800s. The vessel reappeared in the city’s harbor **years after it was presumed lost**, but with **no living crew** on board.

For decades, **locals have avoided the ship**, speaking in hushed tones of **phantom crewmen**, eerie **fog that swallows the dock**, and the sensation that the **ship is never quite in the same place twice**. Some claim the ship **vanishes completely on certain nights**, leaving nothing but **rippling water where it once was**.

Though some believe the **Eldermoor** is merely a cursed relic of the past, **others say it is a prison for lost souls**, those who perished in an act of **betrayal, mutiny, or worse**. Some whisper that a **cursed treasure** lies hidden within its hull, but no one who has sought it has ever returned.

## Nursery Rhyme
A ship adrift on silver tide,
It fades, it shifts, it steps aside.
A deck with footprints, yet no sound,
A treasure lost, yet never found.
A lantern sways, a whisper calls—
Come claim your prize… and join them all.

Through storm and fog, through night and wane,
The ship still drifts, it calls your name.
Step aboard, the captain grins,
Once inside, no one wins.
