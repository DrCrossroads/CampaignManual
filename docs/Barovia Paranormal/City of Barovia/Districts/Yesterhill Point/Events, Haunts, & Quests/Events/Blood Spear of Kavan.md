The spirit of Kavan, a long-dead barbarian chieftain, reaches out to one of the characters, preferably a barbarian, a druid, or a ranger. Read the following text to that character's player:
>You hear a whisper, a deep voice carried on the wind. "Long have I waited," it says, "for one who is worthy. My spear hungers for blood. Retrieve it, and rule these forests in my stead, just like the mighty warriors from the early days of the Whispering Wall."

The character feels drawn to one of the [[Cairns]] on the hillside. When the character approaches within 30 feet of it, the presence of Kavan's magic spear under the rocks is felt.

#### TREASURE
The rocks of the cairn are heavy but can be rolled aside, revealing a blood spear lying amid Kavan's moldy bones. Any creature can wield the spear, but only the character chosen by Kavan to wield it gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
