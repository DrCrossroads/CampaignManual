## Descriptions
### _(The Wind-Swept Ruins, The City’s Forgotten Gods)_

Yesterhill Point is a **windswept district**, perched precariously on the edge of the city’s **rocky coastline.** Once a sacred site, it now stands as **a vast, open expanse of ancient ruins and abandoned shrines**.

- **Notable Locations:**
    - **The Circle of the Forsaken** – A ring of **blackened, crumbling stones**, still pulsing with **strange energy**.
    - **The Drowned Temple** – A **half-sunken cathedral**, where **preachers once worshiped something before the Eternal Light.**
    - **The Hanging Cliffs** – A dangerous **sea-blasted precipice**, where people vanish in **the dead of night.**
- **Atmosphere:**
    - The constant **roar of the sea**, and the sensation that **something is listening**.
    - **Unmarked graves litter the hills**, and figures **sometimes move between them at night.**
    - **Druidic symbols** are occasionally found **carved into stone**, though no one knows who made them.
