### **Quest Hook: A City Thirsting for Vice**

The **Martikov Family** once controlled the underground liquor trade, supplying the entire city with wine and spirits. But their latest shipment never arrived, the eldest son, [[Adrian Martikov]] is missing, and their reserves are running dangerously low. Without a new supply, their empire—and the city's black market—will crumble.

With bootlegging in crisis, the **Martikov Family** offers the party a job:

- **Find out what happened to the missing shipments**.
- **Find Adrian Martikov**
- **Secure new liquor sources, by force if necessary**.
- **Ensure the Church of the Eternal Light doesn't seize total control of alcohol distribution**.

### **Leads and Suspicions**

The party is given three possible leads:

1. **The Church’s Involvement:** Whispers on the street suggest that the Church of the Eternal Light has begun confiscating more alcohol than usual. But why? A corrupt priest, Father Yarek, has been spotted meeting with Purifiers near an old **warehouse in the Misty Docks**.
2. **The Drowned Circle and the Cursed Vats:** A gang of druidic fanatics has been seen lurking near old **distilleries and aging cellars** in the countryside. The Martikovs believe they are poisoning the remaining stock or performing dark rituals to spoil the wine.
3. **Baba Lysaga’s Sinister Bargain:** Deep in the swamps outside the city, an old hag named **[[Baba Lysaga CR 11]]** has been offering desperate bootleggers "protection"—but those who deal with her never return the same.

###### **Baba Lysaga’s Role in the Poisoning of the Wine**
Baba Lysaga, a powerful hag and one of the **oldest servants of Strahd**, saw an opportunity in the city’s growing thirst for contraband liquor. She **assisted The Drowned Circle in corrupting the wine**—not out of loyalty to their dark oceanic god, but for her own benefit.

She **ensured that she alone possessed the last untainted reserves** of wine and spirits, allowing her to:

- **Control desperate bootleggers and criminals**, forcing them into her service.
- **Exploit the city’s chaos**, offering her own enchanted liquors in exchange for dark pacts.
- **Weaken the populace**, allowing Strahd’s influence to spread through addiction and despair.

Her magic helped the druids **perfect their corruption**, enhancing the effects of the parasitic spores that turned drinkers into mindless thralls. However, she kept a portion of the final, untainted reserves hidden in her **swamp lair**, intending to be the sole supplier when the city’s need became unbearable.

### **Act 1: A Poisoned Trade**

#### **The Setup: A City Thirsting for Vice**

The Prohibition has thrown the city into turmoil. **The Mafia** struggles to keep up with demand for illegal alcohol, smuggling barrels through hidden tunnels, bribing guards, and running underground speakeasies. **The Church of the Eternal Light** is tightening its grip, sending out **Purifiers** to burn contraband and execute suspected bootleggers. **The common folk are desperate**, willing to pay exorbitant sums—or kill—for a single drink.

But something **far worse than prohibition** has struck the illicit liquor trade.

#### **The Problem: A Deadly Contamination**

Whispers spread through the criminal underworld—**people are dying from the drinks.** At first, it seemed like a bad batch, but the truth is far more sinister. Victims who consume the poisoned wine and liquor don’t just get sick—**they change**:

- **First Stage:** Uncontrollable thirst, hallucinations, hearing whispers in the dark.
- **Second Stage:** Bloodshot eyes, veins turning black, violent outbursts.
- **Final Stage:** Transformation into **mindless, aberrant thralls** driven by an overwhelming urge to **serve something lurking in the deep sea**.

The poisoned liquor has devastated the black market. Entire **speakeasies have gone silent**, their patrons missing or found brutally murdered. **The Mafia families are in chaos**, accusing each other of sabotage. **The Church is using the crisis to justify mass purges**—public executions of bootleggers and suspected drinkers have become daily spectacles.

#### **The Mafia’s Plea: Finding the Poisoner**

The party is approached by one of the Mafia’s underbosses—a hardened bootlegger named **Vito "Black Vines" Morello**, whose men were among the first to fall victim to the tainted liquor.

> _“We’ve got a rat, or worse. Someone’s poisoning the supply. We’re bleeding money, losing men. We need this fixed—quietly. You find who did this, and you’ll be drinking free for life. You don’t? Well, this whole damn city’s gonna burn.”_

He tasks the party with:

1. **Investigating the missing shipments** – Several barrels **never reached their destinations**
2. **Tracking down a surviving victim** – Few drinkers **survived the poisoning**—if they can still be considered human.
3. **Infiltrating the Church’s secret warehouses** – The Purifiers have been **seizing illegal shipments**. Did they tamper with the supply?

#### **Investigation Leads: The Web of Corruption**

As the party investigates, they uncover **conflicting clues**, drawing them deeper into a tangled web of intrigue.

- **Surviving Victims** (Clue: Aberrant Infection)
    - A **deranged ex-bootlegger** named _Tomás Varelli_ is locked in a backroom of a speakeasy, **restrained with silver chains**.
    - He **screams about the sea**, about “_the mother’s voice_,” and how he “_sees the tendrils in the dark._”
    - If freed, he **attacks the party in a blind rage** but mutters cryptic phrases about **Yesterhill Point** before collapsing.
    - A **Medicine (DC 16) or Arcana (DC 14) check** reveals **his body is mutating**, growing strange, chitinous scales.
- **Stolen Shipments** (Clue: The Druids’ Hand)
    - **An entire warehouse of alcohol vanished**—**not stolen by rival bootleggers**, but **dragged away**.
    - A bartender confesses that **"hooded figures"** were seen near the docks the night the shipments went missing.
    - Following the trail, the party finds **barrels floating in the harbor**, black ichor seeping from the cracks.
    - Investigation (DC 15) reveals **druidic runes carved into the wood**—a mark of the **Yesterhill Point cultists**.
- **The Church’s Secret Stash** (Clue: The High Clerics’ Deception)
    - The Church publicly **destroys all confiscated liquor**—but this is a lie.
    - The Purifiers **store barrels in hidden sanctuaries**, distributing them to **the high clerics** who still indulge in vice.
    - Breaking into a Purifier warehouse, the party **finds barrels of untainted liquor**, **alongside** bottles of the poisoned stock.
    - **The Church is hoarding the good supply**—but why? Did they poison the rest?
    - If confronted, a Purifier sneers: _"The drink is the devil’s poison. If the sinners must drink, let them suffer for it."_
	- The party can find the following while investigating:
		- **A ledger of illegal transactions** between the Church and an unknown group outside the city.
		- **A half-dead smuggler** chained in the back, whispering about “something unnatural” attacking the last shipment.

#### **Turning Point: A Race Against Madness**

The party must now decide:

- **Do they investigate Yesterhill Point** to confront the druids?
- **Do they expose the Church’s lies** and risk Purifier wrath?
- **Do they sell the information to the highest bidder**, ensuring their own wealth and survival?

Meanwhile, the **streets grow more dangerous**. More drinkers **turn monstrous**. The Mafia grows desperate. **The Church tightens its grip.** And in the depths of the ocean, something **stirs in the dark, pleased with the chaos.**

### **Act 2: The Rot Beneath the Vines**

The party now knows that **the druids of Yesterhill Point** are behind the poisoned liquor, but their motivations remain unclear. Meanwhile, **the Church of the Eternal Light is hoarding the last untainted alcohol**, and the **Mafia is on the brink of war** over who is responsible for the crisis.

This act plunges the party deep into the heart of the conspiracy, forcing them to navigate dangerous territory, uncover ancient horrors, and choose who—if anyone—deserves their help.

---

#### **Phase 1: Journey to Yesterhill Point**

Yesterhill Point was once a sacred druidic site, but **now it is cursed**. The land is choked by twisted vines, blackened trees, and an unnatural fog that coils around trespassers like living hands.

As the party approaches, they encounter **escalating dangers**:

1. **Patrolling Cultists (Combat or Social)**
    - The party spots a group of **druids and berserkers** chanting around a **floating barrel of tainted wine**, which **seeps into the soil** like blood.
    - If engaged, the druids fight to the death, but a captured one **mutters about "the Mother" and "the Purification."**
    - If the party listens from hiding, they hear a chilling prayer:
        > _“Let the city drink. Let them hear her voice. Soon, they will kneel before the Sea-Mother.”_

2. **The Forest Weeps (Supernatural Event)**
    - The trees **drip with dark sap** that whispers when touched.
    - If a player **drinks or touches too much**, they **suffer hallucinations**: the city burning, people **drowning in an unseen tide**, and a **massive eye staring from the deep.**
    - **Wisdom Save (DC 15)** or gain a short-term madness effect for 1d6 hours.

3. **Baba Lysaga’s Warning (Optional Encounter)**
    - The players may stumble upon a **desecrated shrine**, covered in **raven feathers** and splattered with **fresh blood**.
    - An **old, hunched woman**—Baba Lysaga—sits nearby, speaking to **floating, severed hands** that twitch and claw at the air.
    - She offers cryptic warnings:
        > _"You chase ghosts in the vines. The Mother does not share her prey. Begone, before you drown."_

    - If pressed, she laughs:
        > _"You think the druids did this alone? I gave them the tools. They gave me the last pure casks. A fair trade."_

    - If the players fight her, she summons a **storm of grasping vines** and cackles as she **vanishes into a murder of crows**.

---

#### **Phase 2: The Ritual at Yesterhill Point**

At the **desecrated druidic circle**, the party discovers the **truth**:

###### **The Druidic Plot: The Poisoning is a Ritual**

- The druids are not **just poisoning the liquor**—they are **using the city’s drinkers as vessels** to spread their "Mother’s Will."
- **The poisoned drink does not just kill—it changes people**, turning them into **eldritch thralls** drawn to the sea.
- The druids call this "The Awakening."

##### **The Ritual in Progress**

The **Archdruid, Malachai the Drowned**, stands at the center of the ritual site, surrounded by **twisted followers**. He is an **undead horror**, his body **bloated with seawater**, his fingers ending in **barnacle-covered talons**.

As the party arrives, the druids are **preparing the final batch** of the tainted wine. If completed, it will **spread through the entire city**, ensuring **Barovia’s downfall**.

###### **Ways to Stop the Ritual**

1. **Direct Assault** (Combat Challenge)
    - If the party fights Malachai and his druids, they must also contend with **the vines themselves attacking**, as the land is corrupted.
    - **Each round, the ritual continues** unless someone **disrupts the circle.**
2. **Disrupt the Ritual Circle** (Skill Challenge)
    - Players can use **Arcana, Religion, or Survival (DC 17)** to disrupt the ritual, but **each failure causes a backlash**, dealing **psychic damage** or causing temporary insanity.
    - If successful, the ritual is **weakened**, making Malachai more vulnerable.
3. **Corrupt the Poisoned Supply**
    - If the players are cunning, they can **sabotage the ritual** by pouring in **holy water, alchemical fire, or another toxin**, **ruining the entire batch** before it can be completed.
    - This **infuriates Malachai**, making him reckless.


#### **What’s Next?**

- The surviving cultists whisper of **the Sea-Mother’s coming**.
- Baba Lysaga is **still out there**, watching, scheming.
- The **Church and the Mafia both want revenge**—depending on who the party sided with.
- And deep beneath the **Black Waters**, something **stirs… waiting for another chance.**

---

### **Act 3: Baba Lysaga’s Bargain**

If the party decides to go after Baba Lysaga, they will find that she has untainted liquor, but is unwilling to give for free.

When the party confronts Baba Lysaga, she is **waiting for them**. Her lair is a [[Baba Lysaga CR 11#**Her Lair – The Heart of the Mist**|temple]] enveloped in the mists.

She greets them with amusement:

- _"Oh, my sweet dearies, you’re too late. The city is already mine... They’ll crawl to me, beg for my drinks. And so will you."_
- _"You want the last barrels? I’ll make you a deal... but you won’t like the price."_

She offers the party multiple choices:

1. **Serve Her** – Become her enforcers and ensure her **liquor monopoly** remains intact. In exchange, she will provide **potent, enchanted brews** that grant eldritch boons at a terrible cost.
2. **Kill the High Cleric** – Baba Lysaga wants the **leader of the Church of the Eternal Light dead**. If the party delivers his heart, she will give them the barrels.
3. **Steal a Holy Relic** – She desires an artifact **hidden in the Church’s vaults**, claiming it is a key to unraveling its power.
4. **Drink from the Black Cauldron** – She offers them a **potion of eternal thirst**—a brew that grants unnatural vitality but binds them to her forever.
5. **Refuse & Fight** – If the party refuses, she unleashes her **twisted mongrel thralls**, mutated from bootleggers who tried to cross her.

#### **Final Choice**

- Will they **destroy the remaining liquor**, ending the trade but ensuring a devastating civil war?
- Will they **control the supply themselves**, seizing power but becoming outlaws?
- Will they **side with the Church**, exchanging corruption for oppression?
- Will they **bow to Baba Lysaga**, gaining her eldritch gifts but losing their humanity?

Each choice shapes **the future of Barovia**, determining which faction thrives and which falls.

### **Act 4: The Fallout**

Regardless of how the party handles the confrontation, their actions will have **lasting consequences**.

#### **Ending 1: The City Burns** _(Failure / Partial Success)_

- If the players **fail to stop the ritual**, the **last batch of poisoned liquor reaches the city**.
- Within days, the streets are **filled with eldritch horrors**—people transformed into **twisted thralls** of the Mother.
- The Church **uses this chaos to seize absolute power**, declaring martial law.
- **The Mafia fractures**, its power broken.
- The city is **a haunted ruin**, filled with **wandering, mindless creatures** whispering to the sea.

#### **Ending 2: The Church Rises as Tyrants** _(Bargain with the Church)_

- If the players **expose the Church’s hoarding** but still stop the druids, the **Church uses the victory to cement its rule.**
- **The city is saved, but now it belongs to the Church.**
- The **Purifiers declare alcohol a "devil’s tool," banning all drinking under pain of death.**
- The players may be **rewarded**, but their actions **create an even darker future.**

#### **Ending 3: The Mafia’s New Empire** _(The Underworld Wins)_

- If the players **help the Mafia secure the last pure supply**, the Church is **undermined** and the **Mafia becomes stronger than ever.**
- The city is **saved from eldritch horror**, but **crime reigns supreme**.
- The party is **offered wealth and power**—but at the cost of allowing **corruption and bloodshed** to rule the streets.

#### **Ending 4: Barovia’s Last Hope** _(Balance Restored)_

- If the players **expose the Church AND destroy the last batch**, the city **survives without falling into total darkness.**
- The **Church is weakened**, unable to enforce total rule.
- The **Mafia survives**, but is fractured and diminished.
- The city still **teeters on the edge of chaos**, but **free will remains.**
- The players are seen as **either heroes or dangerous rebels, depending on who you ask.**

#### **Ending 5: A City on Fire** (The Party retrieves the liquor but refuses to distribute)

- **Mafia war ignites** – The crime families turn against each other, each trying to seize control of the last liquor. The streets become a battleground.
- **The Church tightens its grip** – The Purifiers declare alcohol heretical and execute known bootleggers, but their own leaders secretly drink in secret sanctums.
- **The Druidic Corruption Spreads** – If any infected liquor remains in circulation, more citizens **succumb to madness**, and the city **falls under the influence of the deep-sea horror**.
- **Baba Lysaga Ascends** – If left alive, she **takes advantage of the power vacuum**, using her remaining supply to build a cult of desperate, addicted followers who will do anything for a drink.
- **The Party Becomes a Target** – Having played a pivotal role in the city’s collapse (or survival), the party is now **hunted by multiple factions**.
- Alternatively, if they side with **Baba Lysaga**, she will **transform them into her chosen champions**, granting them immense power—but at the cost of their souls.
