_"Bodies are easy to find in this city. The right parts? Now, that takes skill."_

A **black-market mortician** who deals in **stolen cadavers, preserved body parts, and artificial limbs** with eerie enhancements. Operates out of an **abandoned funeral home**, and some say **he can reattach souls**â€”for a price.

ðŸ”¹ **Description**

- A **gaunt, skeletal man** always dressed in a **black suit and gloves**.
- His **eyes are sunken, yet he never blinks**.
- He speaks in **whispers**, no matter how loud the room is.

ðŸ”¹ **How He Operates**

- The Undertaker **doesnâ€™t just sell body partsâ€”he sells improvements**.
- Will pay handsomely for **"fresh" materials** (no questions asked).
- Some customers **come back after death**, looking for **"upgrades"**.

ðŸ”¹ **What He Sells**

- **Grafts and prosthetics**â€”a new arm thatâ€™s **unnaturally strong**, a glass eye that **sees spirits**.
- **Preserved organs**â€”some whisper, some still beat.
- **A service: He can "bring someone back"**â€”but they **never come back the same**.

ðŸ”¹ **Potential Hooks**

- A **powerful figure** was "brought back" but is now **something else**, and the party must investigate.
- The party finds a **stolen corpse**, but itâ€™s missing **key body parts**.
- The Undertaker offers them **a favor**, but in return, they must **dig up something that should have stayed buried**.
