- **Location**: A long-abandoned cemetery at the edge of the city, overtaken by nature. The stones are cracked, the graves forgotten, and the place has been reclaimed by thick, tangled vines and trees. The cemetery was once home to a wealthy family whose graves were moved during the cityâ€™s expansion, leaving only the forgotten and the unknown behind.
- **Hauntings**: This cemetery is haunted by the forgotten souls of those who were never moved or properly buried. The restless dead wander the grounds, many still attached to their unmarked graves, calling out in sorrow and anger. Fog often rolls through the cemetery at night, and the air grows thick with an overwhelming sense of loss. Strange phenomena, like cold spots and the sound of whispering names, are common here.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The grave of the family who originally owned the cemetery is said to hold a cursed heirloom. However, disturbing it could open the cemetery to more malevolent spirits that have been dormant for centuries. The key to solving the mystery may lie in uncovering the history of the original family and their dark secrets.

>Stunted pine trees grow out of the rocky earth in the graveyard near the foundation of the abbey's north wing. The windows of the structure are cracked panes of leaded glass. Ancient gravestones burst from a thin crust of snow in the yard. Beyond the low wall that surrounds the graveyard, the ground falls away. The village lies four hundred feet below, and the view is breathtaking.

Carved into each gravestone is the name of a long-dead priest or nun. Some of the names include Brother Martek, Brother Valen, Sister Constance, and Sister Lenora.

#### SUN'S GRAVE
The gravestone marked X is carved with roses and bears a 3-inch-diameter sun-shaped indentation on its east side. Engraved beneath the indentation is the name PETR0VNA. If Tasha Petrovna's holy symbol (see chapter 4, area K84, crypt 11) is placed in the indentation, both the holy symbol and the indentation vanish. Then read:
>A ray of golden sunlight breaks through the clouds to the west and shines upon the grave. The fog and the gloom shrink from its brilliance as the sunlight causes the gravestone to crack and crumble, revealing a ring within.

The sunray lasts for 1 minute. If the characters smash the gravestone without placing Tasha Petrovna's holy symbol in it first, they find nothing within its remains.
The ring is a *ring of regeneration*

Ghouls appear at night and roam the graveyard.
