##### (Vanished Estate)

- **Location**: A once-grand estate, now a mere shadow of its former self, located on the edge of town in the North-eastern corner of Krezk Valley. The estate was abandoned after a brutal double-murder involving the owners, a wealthy couple who were found dead in mysterious circumstances.
- **Hauntings**: A mansion with no occupants, but strange lights flicker in its windows, and there’s a constant sense of foreboding. Rumors say the couple’s ghosts haunt the estate, reenacting their final night in a deadly game of betrayal.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The couple’s death is rumored to have been orchestrated by an occult society, and their ghosts may be trying to pass on clues to stop a similar fate from occurring again.

## Nursery Rhyme
She waits by the window, he paces the hall,
Footsteps echo, a whisper, a call.
The wine was poured, the vows were made,
A love so strong, yet still betrayed.

They danced, they dined, they said goodnight,
Then met their end by candlelight.
Now hand in hand, they roam the floor,
Forever waiting at the door.

The knives still gleam, the blood still stains,
Their hollow love, their ghostly chains.
Forever bound, they seek, they wail—
Two lovers lost in endless tale.

Two lovers lost, two voices call,
Through hollow halls and crumbling wall.
They call for help, they call in vain,
Bound forever by their pain.

## Overview
Once a symbol of **wealth and prestige**, the **Holloway Estate** now stands **silent and forsaken** on the **edge of Krezk Valley**, its towering **gables and stone façade** marred by **decay and creeping ivy**. The windows—though covered in grime—sometimes **flicker with an eerie glow**, as if **the past refuses to stay buried.**

The estate was abandoned following the **gruesome double murder** of its owners, **Victor and Eleanor Holloway**, a powerful couple with deep political and financial ties. They were found **dead in their bedroom**, their bodies **positioned ritualistically**, with no sign of forced entry. The **official report** dismissed the deaths as **a tragic act of murder-suicide**, but whispers in the city tell another story—one of **occult influence, secret dealings, and an unfinished ritual.**
