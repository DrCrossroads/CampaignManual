##### (Carnival of Shadows)

- **Location**: A once-popular amusement park that closed after a series of mysterious accidents and disappearances in the early 1920s. Now, it stands as a decaying relic, the rides rusted, the booths empty, and the attractions eerie in their abandonment.
- **Hauntings**: The park is haunted by the spirits of the workers and visitors who perished in the accidents. The Ferris wheel turns slowly in the wind, creaking ominously, and the sounds of carnival music can sometimes be heard echoing from the empty grounds. Clowns’ faces seem to watch visitors from the old posters, and those who venture too deep into the park report feeling like they are being followed by ghostly figures, particularly around the abandoned funhouse.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The amusement park was built over an old burial ground, and it’s said that the accidents were no mere coincidence but part of a ritualistic curse placed on the land. The souls of the dead are still tethered to the park, waiting for someone to break the chain that binds them—or, perhaps, for someone to continue the twisted rites.

A traveling carnival arrives, filled with bizarre attractions and sinister performers. Each ride or show is a trap for the unwary, and the carnival’s leaders have ties to dark powers.

## Nursery Rhyme
Round and round, the horses ride,
No one living left inside.
Music plays, but none can hear,
A ticket bought—a life too dear.

The calliope still plays at night,
A hollow tune, a child's delight.
The painted horses rear and strain,
Their riders gone, their ropes remain.
Step inside, take your seat,
The show goes on—the price is steep.

Round and round the horses glide,
But riders left and never cried.
The bell still rings, the wheels still turn,
A ghostly fair for none to yearn.

### **The Forgotten Fairgrounds**

Once a beacon of joy and excitement, **Wellington Amusement Park** (better known now as **The Forgotten Fairgrounds**) fell into disrepair after a string of grisly accidents and unexplained disappearances in the early 1920s. Now, it stands as a crumbling husk of its former self, overtaken by rust, weeds, and a lingering, suffocating sense of unease.

### **General Atmosphere & Supernatural Occurrences**

- **Phantom Carnival Music**: Faint, off-key carnival tunes drift through the air, emanating from unseen sources. Sometimes, the music stops abruptly, only for an eerie silence to follow.
- **Watching Eyes**: The old posters and painted clown faces adorning the walls seem to change expression when not being directly observed. Some even appear to blink.
- **Residual Specters**: Ghostly figures of carnival-goers and workers appear in glimpses, replaying their final moments before vanishing.
- **The Lurker**: Something unseen follows anyone who dares explore the fairgrounds, its presence manifesting as flickering shadows, cold breath against the neck, or the sensation of fingers brushing against skin.

## **Notable Locations**

### **The Entrance & Ticket Booths**

Once the threshold of excitement, the rusted entrance gates now groan in the wind, swinging open on their own as if beckoning visitors inside. The old ticket booths still have stacks of faded tickets, but when touched, they disintegrate into dust. Occasionally, a disembodied voice mutters, _"Step right up..."_

**Encounters:**
- A **phantom attendant** appears behind a booth, offering a "free pass" in a raspy voice. If the ticket is accepted, the holder begins seeing the park as it once was—lively and bright—but the spirits of the dead mingle among the living, watching with hollow eyes.
- An old **logbook** lists the names of staff members, but one name has been repeatedly scratched out—digging deeper into this could reveal a lost soul seeking vengeance.

### **The Ferris Wheel**

Standing like a skeletal giant, the rusted Ferris wheel groans as it turns ever so slowly in the wind, though no power runs through the park. At night, ghostly lights flicker along the rim, and silhouettes can be seen in the passenger cars—figures who should not be there.

**Encounters:**
- If someone steps into a **Ferris wheel car**, it suddenly lurches into motion, lifting them high above the park. From the top, they can glimpse _moving figures_ below that should not exist—perhaps shadowy performers from the past, or something worse.
- **Ghostly laughter** erupts from empty cars, sometimes followed by the bloodcurdling screams of someone falling.
- A **spectral child** appears in one of the cars, staring at the players. If questioned, she whispers, _"Don’t let him see you."_

---

### **The Funhouse**

Once a beloved attraction, the funhouse is now a twisting maze of shattered mirrors, warped halls, and darkness. The reflections in the mirrors do not always match reality, sometimes revealing **something standing behind the characters** or showing distorted versions of themselves.

**Encounters:**
- Some mirrors **trap reflections**, preventing a character’s reflection from moving. Later, the real person might find their reflection acting independently, mimicking their worst fears.
- **A hallway never ends**—walking forward only leads back to the same place. The only way out is by moving backward.
- The **Jester**: A laughing, masked figure stalks the funhouse, appearing in the mirrors but never in reality—until the moment a player **turns a corner and finds him waiting.**

---

### **The Roller Coaster Ruins**

The old wooden roller coaster collapsed years ago, but the skeletal track remains, twisting into the sky like a ribcage. It’s said that the final crash—the one that shut the park down—left some of the riders behind.

**Encounters:**

- The ghostly sounds of a coaster racing along the tracks can sometimes be heard, ending in a violent crash.
- A **single car** remains upright on the track. If approached, players see it shake as if something inside is trying to escape.
- A **ticket stub** on the ground bears the name of a missing person—one who vanished on the night of the crash.

### **The Hall of Wonders (Sideshow Tent)**

A tattered circus tent houses forgotten oddities: rusted cages, broken displays, and mannequins dressed in faded costumes. The sign above reads: _Step Inside for the Greatest Wonders You’ll Ever See!_—though something scratched out the last word and replaced it with _Fear._

**Encounters:**

- A row of **doll-like mannequins** dressed as sideshow performers begins twitching when players enter.
- The **ghost of a strongman**, chained to a post, pleads for release—but his hands are **elongated claws**, and his mouth is too wide.
- A **crimson curtain** leads to an unseen exhibit. If opened, there’s _nothing_ behind it—until the curtain closes, and suddenly a **massive, hunched figure** is standing there.

---

### **The Carousels**

The painted horses are cracked and weathered, their hollow eyes watching. If listened to closely, the carousel plays _distorted calliope music_—but only when no one is looking.

**Encounters:**

- A **childlike voice** whispers, _"One more ride?"_ If a player agrees, the carousel begins spinning, showing glimpses of **how each rider will die** in its mirrors.
- A **horse’s head moves**, snapping toward anyone nearby. If ignored, it whispers their name.
- **The ride refuses to stop**, spinning faster and faster, the laughter of unseen children growing more hysterical.

---

### **Paranormal Investigation Mechanics**

- **Spirit Residue**: Ectoplasmic smears or strange chalk markings appear at significant locations, revealing clues about the park’s tragic past.
- **Ghostly EVP Recordings**: Capturing whispers or carnival sounds on a recorder that weren’t audible in real time.
- **Objects Moving on Their Own**: Cameras set up in different locations may capture **shadows moving**, or entire attractions operating when no one is near them.
- **Temperature Drops**: Sudden, intense cold around specific areas—sometimes accompanied by faint breathy whispers.
- **Interactive Visions**: Players may briefly "slip" into the past, witnessing accidents and tragedies as if they were standing in them—sometimes _as the victims._

**Final Warning:**  
At the park’s center, near the **burned-down main office**, there’s an old **wooden sign** covered in vines. If uncovered, it reads:

>**"We never close."**
>And below it, scratched into the wood, in **fresh letters:**
>**"Not even now."**
