_A Hidden Wereraven Bootlegging Operation in Krezk Valley_

#### **Overview**
Tucked away in the **southern end of Krezk Valley**, where the **dense forest creeps into the city’s industrial outskirts**, stands the **Black Feather Distillery.** To the untrained eye, it appears to be just another **abandoned grain mill**, its wooden walls weathered and scarred by time. However, those in the know recognize it as **the beating heart of Barovia’s finest illicit liquor trade.**

Run by the **Keepers of the Black Feather**, a secretive wereraven syndicate, the distillery produces and smuggles **high-quality moonshine, whiskey, and absinthe.** Their operation is protected by a combination of **stealth, trickery, and supernatural foresight.** The wereravens use their ability to **fly and blend into the cityscape** to avoid both authorities and rival bootleggers.

### **1. The "Abandoned" Mill (Main Entrance)**

- A **dilapidated grain mill** with a **rusted sign that reads "Crawford's Milling"**—a front for the real business.
- Thick vines climb the wooden walls, partially obscuring the **large sliding doors.**
- The inside appears **dusty and abandoned,** with a few broken crates and rusty tools lying around. A keen eye (DC 15 Investigation) will notice **fresh footprints in the dust** leading toward a hidden hatch.
- **Secret Entrance:** The hatch, hidden beneath a pile of grain sacks, leads to a narrow staircase descending into the main distillery.

### **2. The Black Feather Distillery (Underground)**

- A sprawling **underground operation** carved into the **earth and reinforced with old railway beams.**
- Rows of **copper stills, fermentation barrels, and glass bottles** line the walls, exuding the scent of **fermented rye, barley, and sharp alcohol.**
- A large **chalkboard ledger** lists ongoing shipments, with names of speakeasies and mob contacts.
- Wereravens move efficiently, **bottling liquor, packaging crates, and preparing shipments.**

### **3. The Smuggler's Run (Tunnels & Hidden Exits)**

- A series of **narrow tunnels** snake through the earth, connecting to **hidden exits in the forest and abandoned warehouses.**
- **One tunnel leads directly to a concealed loading dock**, where trucks and wagons ferry barrels out under the cover of night.
- **Escape Route:** In an emergency, a flooded tunnel leads to a river outlet **deep in the forest.**

### **4. The Aviary (Wereraven Roost)**

- A **hidden loft** above the main distillery serves as a resting area for wereravens.
- The rafters are **lined with perches and nests**, where they can perch in raven form and observe their domain.
- **Secret Message System:** A collection of **coded notes** is hidden among the straw, used for communication between wereravens and allied factions.

### **5. The Tasting Room & Secret Speakeasy ("The Hollow")**

- A **lavish but discreet speakeasy** for trusted clientele.
- **Low candlelight, rich mahogany tables, and a vintage piano** give it an air of quiet sophistication.
- Patrons sip on **Black Feather Bourbon** or the infamous **Green Veil Absinthe.**
- A **false shelf behind the bar** conceals a stash of enchanted weapons, silver bullets, and escape tunnels.

### **6. The Wardens' Chamber (Boss's Office)**

- A **dimly lit room filled with maps, ledgers, and smuggling routes**.
- A large **raven skull** hangs above the desk, symbolizing the wereravens' silent dominion.
- A **lockbox containing emergency funds** (500 GP in mixed currencies) is hidden beneath the floorboards.
