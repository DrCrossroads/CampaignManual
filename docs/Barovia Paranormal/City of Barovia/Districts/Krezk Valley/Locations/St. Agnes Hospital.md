##### The Forgotten Ward

## Overview
Once a beacon of modern medicine, **St. Agnes Hospital** now stands as a decayed monument to tragedy. Shuttered years ago after whispers of unethical experiments and unexplained deaths, its empty halls remain haunted by the souls who suffered within. The locals avoid it, claiming the spirits of the dead still linger, waiting for someone to uncover the hospital’s secrets… or join them.

### **Notable Areas & Encounters**

### **1. The Emergency Room - The Last Moments**

**Atmosphere:**
- Rusting gurneys sit abandoned, some overturned.
- Medical charts and old syringes litter the floor.
- Overhead lights flicker erratically, bathing the room in a sickly glow.

**Haunted Events:**
- As the characters step inside, **ghostly doctors and nurses** appear in flashes, frantically working on invisible patients before vanishing.
- A **phantom ambulance siren** wails, and for a brief moment, the hospital **appears as it once was—pristine and full of life**—before snapping back to decay.
- **Paranormal Clue:** An old intercom crackles to life, whispering a name that no one recognizes—perhaps a patient who died mysteriously here.

### **2. The Surgical Theater - The Butcher’s Domain**

**Atmosphere:**
- Rusted surgical instruments lie scattered on a bloodstained operating table.
- The observation gallery above is lined with cracked glass, and faint whispers can be heard.

**Haunted Events:**

- A **phantom surgeon** appears, his face obscured by an old surgical mask. He moves toward the characters **as if preparing to operate** before vanishing.

**Encounter:**
- **A lingering "patient" manifests**—a mass of surgical scars and hollow eyes. It shambles toward the party, attacking with spectral scalpels. It can be banished if the characters burn the old **patient files** in the room.

### **3. The Isolation Ward - The Whispering Walls**

**Atmosphere:**

- A locked door rattles violently, as though **something inside is trying to escape**.
- Shadows move on their own, stretching and twisting.

**Encounter:**

### **4. The Nursery - The Forgotten Children**

**Atmosphere:**
- Dusty wooden cribs sit in eerie silence.
- A mobile over one crib still **turns on its own**, playing a **broken lullaby**.

- The lights flicker, and for a brief moment, the characters see **every drawer open, filled with shadowy figures**.

**Encounter:**
- A **corpse suddenly moves**, gasping for air and grabbing the nearest character, whispering, **"Bury me properly."** If the characters perform a burial or a cleansing ritual, the spirit **moves on peacefully**. If ignored, it **rises as a wraith** and attacks.

## **Paranormal Investigation Mechanics**

1. **Spirit Residue Detection**
    - Using special equipment (EMF readers, spirit boards, or recording devices), players can detect **"residue" left by spirits**. Certain locations will cause their equipment to go **haywire**, signaling a significant event.
2. **Echoes of the Dead**
    - Some rooms replay past **"echoes"** of the hospital’s history. These flashes of the past show **important moments** but may also cause characters to **witness their own deaths** if they stay too long.
3. **The Rift Between Worlds**
    - The hospital sits **between the veil of life and death**. Investigators who stay too long may find **themselves fading**, becoming semi-transparent and hearing whispers from the other side.
4. **Unfinished Business**
    - The spirits can only rest when **their stories are completed**. If players find hospital records, they can match them to the lingering ghosts and help them **pass on** (or, in some cases, reveal their darker secrets).

## **Plot Hooks**

- **The Missing Heir**: A wealthy family’s heir was last seen investigating **St. Agnes Hospital** and never returned. Finding him **reveals he has been "taken" by the hospital itself**—his spirit trapped unless the characters intervene.
- **The Black Ledger**: A secret record book exists somewhere in the hospital, containing **the names of all patients experimented on**. Finding it could expose the hospital’s dark past—but **someone powerful wants it buried.**
- **The Phantom Nurse**: A nurse in white appears in visions, **pleading for help**. Following her leads to **the morgue**, where her **remains were hidden** after she tried to expose the hospital’s crimes.
