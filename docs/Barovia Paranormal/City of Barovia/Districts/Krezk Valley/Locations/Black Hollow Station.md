##### The Lost Railway Station

**Location**: A deserted, long-abandoned train station that was once a bustling stop for travelers, but mysteriously ceased operations in the early 1920s. The trains no longer run, but the station remains intact.
- **Hauntings**: Late at night, you can still hear the ghostly sounds of a train pulling into the station. Shadows flicker by the windows, and passengers' faces can be seen in the station’s waiting rooms, waiting for trains that never come.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The station may be the site of a dangerous ghostly "train" that transports people to an unknown destination, leaving those who board trapped in the world between the living and the dead.

## Nursery Rhyme
Train on track, steam so high,
Ghostly faces passing by.
Step aboard, they’ll take your hand,
To somewhere far, to nowhere land.

The train pulls in, the train pulls out,
But none aboard can scream or shout.
A one-way trip, a ghostly track,
If you get on, you won’t come back.

The whistle blows, the platform waits,
No turning back, you’ve sealed your fate.
A train pulls in, its doors swing wide,
No driver seen, no place to hide.

"Step aboard", a journey calls—
"To ghostly lands beyond these walls."
The tracks will hum, the lights will gleam,
But once you’re gone, was it a dream?

Train on track, steam so high,
Ghostly faces passing by.
Step aboard, they’ll take your hand,
To somewhere far, to nowhere land.

## Overview
Once a thriving hub of travel and commerce, **Black Hollow Station** has stood silent for nearly a century. Officially, the station shut down in 1923 due to financial struggles, but locals whisper of **an unscheduled midnight train** that still arrives, its passengers long dead.

The **architecture remains eerily well-preserved**, though dust coats the floors and ivy creeps through cracked windows. Lanterns along the platform flicker with an unseen energy, sometimes **glowing as if expecting an incoming train.** Travelers who venture too close report hearing **phantom announcements** echoing through the empty halls, and some claim to have seen **the silhouettes of passengers still waiting for their departure.**

## **Notable Locations**

### **1. The Grand Hall** (Main Entrance)

Once an opulent entryway, the grand hall boasts soaring arches, intricate tilework, and a massive **station clock** frozen at **11:57 PM.** The air feels thick with **stagnant anticipation**, as if the building itself is holding its breath.

**Encounters & Clues:**

- The station’s **old schedule board** sometimes updates itself with destinations that don't exist, like _Nowhere Junction_ or _Last Stop Hollow._
- The faint scent of **cigar smoke and perfume** lingers in the air, despite no one being present.
- Any attempt to **adjust the frozen clock hands** results in the hands **ticking backward** before snapping back to 11:57.
- **A station master’s bell sits on the counter.** Ringing it **summons a shadowy figure** in a conductor’s uniform—but it doesn’t speak. It only raises a skeletal hand and points **toward the platform.**

### **2. The Abandoned Waiting Room**

Rows of dust-covered wooden benches sit beneath dim, flickering gas lamps. A **passenger manifest from 1923** remains on the station master’s desk, listing names of people who supposedly left on the final train. However, their **departure times are all listed as "??:??"**, and some names have been scratched out entirely.

**Encounters & Clues:**
- **Ghostly passengers** can be seen sitting in the chairs if observed through reflections (mirrors, glass, or even a camera lens). If directly looked at, the chairs appear empty.
- A **single suitcase** remains on the floor, locked shut. If forced open, it contains:
    - **A dress or suit from the 1920s, freshly pressed.**
    - **A pocket watch that still ticks—except it only moves when no one is watching.**
    - **A letter addressed to someone who "never made it to the train."**
- Occasionally, an unseen presence **shifts a chair or drops a coin**, as if someone just left in a hurry.

### **3. The Ticket Booths**

The old booths still stand, their glass windows cracked but intact. A few **faded tickets** remain inside, though none have recognizable destinations.

**Encounters & Clues:**
- If a player picks up a **ticket**, they begin to hear **whispered station announcements**—but only things **meant for them.**
- A **disembodied handprint** sometimes appears on the glass, pressing from the inside.
- **A broken intercom speaker crackles to life**, playing a conductor’s voice: _"Now boarding. Last chance to depart."_

---

### **4. The Platform & Train Tracks**

The train platform is covered in a fine layer of mist, despite there being no obvious source of moisture. The **rails remain polished**, as if still in use. A single lantern **glows brighter and brighter at 11:57 PM** before suddenly **snuffing out at midnight.**

**Encounters & Clues:**
- **Ghostly figures** can sometimes be seen stepping onto the platform, waiting in eerie silence before fading away.
- A **metal sign sways in the wind**, though there is no wind inside the station. It reads:  
    >_"⚠️ DO NOT BOARD THE MIDNIGHT TRAIN ⚠️"_
- **At precisely midnight, the air fills with the deafening sound of a steam whistle**—but no train is present. However, if someone listens closely, they may hear **distant screaming.**

---

### **5. The Luggage Room**

A **maze of abandoned suitcases and trunks** lies within this storage area. Many of them remain sealed, as if **waiting to be retrieved.**

**Encounters & Clues:**
- A **lone bellhop ghost** wanders through the aisles, **carrying bags that aren’t there.** If spoken to, he simply repeats:  
    >_"Your bags are already aboard. No need to worry."_
- One suitcase, if opened, **contains old newspapers from 1923** with a disturbing headline:  
    >_"MYSTERY TRAIN VANISHES WITH DOZENS ABOARD – STATION SHUTS DOWN IMMEDIATELY AFTER"_
- Some luggage **rattles** as if something inside is still… alive.

---

### **6. The Conductor’s Office**

This office once belonged to **Station Master Edwin Carrington**, the last known employee to see the midnight train before its disappearance. The **door is locked from the inside**, and a **rotted, skeletal hand still clutches the key.**

**Encounters & Clues:**

- **A journal on the desk** details the station master’s paranoia leading up to the station’s closure. His final entry reads:  
    >_"They keep asking for their tickets, but there’s nowhere left to take them. I won’t let them leave. Not again."_
- A **massive map of the railway system** on the wall has **one extra set of tracks drawn in red ink**—leading **somewhere off the known grid.**
- If a player spends too long inside, they might hear a **knock from the closet.** Inside is… **an old conductor’s uniform, but it is standing upright.**

## **The Midnight Train & Its Curse**

If the investigators remain in the station until **midnight**, a spectral **train arrives at the platform.** It appears as a shimmering, half-real locomotive, its interior lights flickering with unnatural energy.

- A **ghostly conductor** steps off, calling for passengers.
- Anyone who **steps aboard vanishes immediately**—but glimpses of them can be seen in the station’s windows **forever after.**
- If someone **watches the train from a distance**, they see **dozens of hands pressed against the windows**—begging for release.
- The train does **not stop** until it reaches its unknown destination, a place between **life and death.**

---

## **Paranormal Investigation Mechanics**

>**"DON’T BE ONE OF THEM."**
