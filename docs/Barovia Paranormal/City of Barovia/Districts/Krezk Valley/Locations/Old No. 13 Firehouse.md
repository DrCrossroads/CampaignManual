- **Location**: An old firehouse, once a source of pride for the city’s first responders, now abandoned for decades. It stands as a lonely, looming structure, its bell tower calling out to no one. The firehouse is said to be the site of a tragic fire in the late 1890s that killed several firefighters under mysterious circumstances, and it was quickly shut down afterward.
- **Hauntings**: Apparitions of the lost firefighters are often seen in the firehouse, reenacting their last moments before the deadly fire broke out. The heavy scent of smoke lingers in the air, and there’s a constant creaking and groaning of the old wooden floors. Some even claim the bell rings at midnight, but when they check, no one is there.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: One of the firefighters had been investigating strange, supernatural fires occurring throughout the city, and his personal journals may reveal that the firehouse itself was a focal point for an evil that is now stirring again. The firehouse may even be the gateway for the restless souls of those lost in the blaze.

## Nursery Rhyme
The flames arose, the bells did cry,
The men rushed in, yet still they died.
The fire's gone, but listen near,
The screams remain, so sharp and clear.

The flames still flicker, the siren moans,
But all inside are dust and bones.
See them rush, hear them shout,
Fighting fires long burned out.

The bell still rings, the flames still rise,
A call for help, ignored by skies.
Their boots hit stone, they rush, they fight,
But fire eats both flesh and night.
Ashes whisper, cinders glow,
They run, they burn, yet never go.

## Overview
A once-proud symbol of the city's firefighting legacy, **Old No. 13 Firehouse** now stands **abandoned**, its red brick exterior blackened with age. The **tall bell tower**, once used to signal emergencies, **remains intact but silent**—except for those nights when **the bell tolls at midnight**. Some claim it rings on its own, while others insist they hear **the voices of unseen firefighters** calling out from within.

The firehouse was shuttered after **a devastating fire in the late 1890s** claimed the lives of an entire company of firefighters. Official reports said the blaze was an accident, but whispers among locals tell a different story: one of **mysterious fires**, an unseen force, and a firefighter who may have gotten too close to the truth.
