*When the bell tolls, they vanish*

## Background

Twenty years ago, several children vanished from the Hollow Bell Schoolhouse. Only one was found—traumatized, unable to speak of what they’d seen. The school was abandoned shortly after. Now, as the mist rolls back in, it’s happening again.

The surviving PC has deeply buried memories of this place. Their trauma is reawakened when cries of children echo from within, and the schoolhouse bell tolls once more.

---

### Location
A fog-shrouded, two-story schoolhouse with boarded windows, a rusted bell tower, collapsed rear wing, and moss covered stone foundations on the outskirts of Krezk Valley.

There is a constant drizzle and the fog rolls in early.

### Major Themes
- Childhood trauma
- Memory distortion
- Fear of the unknown
- Eldritch corruption

### Main NPC
- **Mrs. Annelise Hallow**: Former teacher; now senile. May babble cryptic truths.

### Goals
- Investigate the schoolhouse
- Discover the truth of the past
- Rescue any recently taken children
- Confront the Stranger Beyond the Blackboard

## Haunt Progression: The Toll of the Bell

Each time the school bell tolls (once every 30 minutes in-game or after each major scene/room), the haunt worsens:

|Bell Toll|Effect|
|---|---|
|1st|Temperature drops; breath mists. Whispers echo faintly.|
|2nd|Children’s shadows begin appearing on walls. Desks shift unnaturally.|
|3rd|Chalkboards rewrite themselves—lessons become crying pleas. Screams echo faintly.|
|4th|PCs see brief flashes of themselves as children, distorted and afraid.|
|5th|PCs begin hearing the Stranger calling their names. Wisdom saves or suffer psychic damage.|
|6th|The veil between worlds breaks. A rift opens to the Stranger’s realm.|
### Haunting Manifestations

- **Children Crying:** PCs within 30 ft must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or suffer Disadvantage on Perception checks and Dexterity saving throws until they leave the area.
- **Desks Shifting:** Once per round in combat, a desk can move to block a path or trip a PC (DC 14 Dex save or fall prone).
- **Children’s Shadows:** Shadows of children mimic PC movements. If a PC fails a DC 15 Wisdom save while interacting with one, they suffer 3d6 psychic damage and are Frightened for 1 minute.
- **Living Chalkboards:** The chalkboards rewrite themselves to depict horrible scenes from the past. PCs can attempt a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check to learn what really happened here.

| 3    | You sit at your desk, but your hands are small. You are a child again. |
| 4    | You run down a hallway that never ends. Your name echoes behind you.   |

## Map
### Playground


### Ground Floor
Entry Hall: Creaking floorboards, rotted trophies, newspaper clippings nailed to the wall.

Nursery Room: Abandoned toys animate when touched.

Principal’s Office: Locked drawer contains ritual notes, fragments of a chalk mural.

Hallway: Desks rearrange themselves. Perception check DC 14 to notice.

Closet: Inside hangs a child's coat. Opening it triggers a brief flashback.

### Second Floor

Library: Books with blank pages. One contains a story that describes the party’s exact actions.

Classroom A & B: A chalkboard that changes when unobserved. Scrapbooks of vanished children.

Teacher's Lounge: Coffee cups untouched. A mirror here is a portal.

### Attic

Doodles cover the walls. One is a moving eye.

### Basement

## Puzzle
### The Cosmic Eye Chalk Mural

- **Setup:** A massive chalk mural is fragmented across several classrooms. Each part is drawn in a swirling, alien language.
- **Discovery:** Finding all 4 pieces requires exploration. Arcana or Investigation checks (DC 15) help decipher the order.
- **Mechanics:** Once placed correctly, the mural shifts into a cosmic eye. PCs must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom save or be stunned for 1 round.
- **Outcome:** The finished puzzle opens a portal to the Stranger’s Realm.

### Clues
- Edward's Drawing: Found in the library. Shows the Stranger pulling children into a square, black, fragmented pool.
- Teacher’s Logbook: Missing pages spell out a sigil if assembled.
- Carving on the desk: Reveals the Stranger’s symbol—an open eye inside a house.
- Old Bell Mechanism: Ringing the bell draws the Stranger closer.

## Transition to the Eldritch Realm
Triggered by stepping through the blackboard in the teacher’s lounge.

Each PC must relive a memory twisted by fear (DM creates short scenes).

### The Stranger’s Realm

**Geography**: Floating schoolroom fragments in a void, connected by mirror-shards and chalk bridges. The bell hangs high over head

Gravity shifts. Unstable.

Background whispers grow louder the longer they remain.

### Boss Fight
The Stranger Beyond the Blackboard

A large creature drawn of chalk. When it moves, it leaves a cloud of white dust.

Creature attempts to trap party members in their own past.

### Resolution
- Rescue the missing children from chalk cocoons.
- Destroy the Stranger’s anchor (the bell, the mural, or the journal).
- PC regains memories—may have led the children into the ritual unknowingly.

---

### Remnant PC Child-Self Encounter

Within the Stranger’s Realm, the surviving PC finds their younger self—a scared, fragmented echo.

- **Mechanics:**
    - Interactions must be carefully handled. DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check to gain trust.
    - If successful, the PC merges with their younger self, regaining a lost memory (GM’s choice, potentially a boon).
    - Failure causes the child-self to be taken by the Stranger, dealing 6d10 psychic damage and causing one level of exhaustion.

---

## Rewards
- Eldritch Trinkets (hair ribbons that glow when lies are spoken, chalk that reveals invisible ink)
- Temporary Boon: "Touched by the Echo" – Advantage on Insight, disadvantage on SAN saves
- Permanent consequence: One PC's reflection behaves independently for a time
