**Overview**: Officially known as the St. Markovia Sanitorium for the Mentally Ill, "The Madhouse" has become a grim legend in the city, a **half-ruined sanatorium or medical research facility** built on the **cliffs overlooking the city**. It was once a **place of healing**, but after the arrival of the Abbot, it has twisted into something **far darker**, a decaying structure shrouded in dark rumors, abandoned by most but still attracting the curious and the desperate.

- **Founding**: Built in the late 19th century, St. Helens was initially celebrated for its innovative treatments and tranquil setting. However, as mental health care methods regressed into brutality during the early 20th century, the asylum became notorious for its harsh conditions and inhumane treatments.
- **Scandals and Secrets**: Multiple scandals surrounding unethical experiments and the disappearances of patients led to the asylum's closure in the late 1920s. Some believe that the spirits of former patients haunt the halls, tormented by the horrors they endured.

###### **Other information**
- **Officially, it is still a sanitarium** run by the **Church of the Eternal Light**, where the “mad” are **sent to be reformed** (or silenced).
- **Unofficially, it is a nightmare of experimentation and inhumanity**, with the Abbot performing grotesque medical procedures that he calls **"holy restorations."**
- The "patients" are his **twisted creations—people sewn together with animal parts** and subjected to horrific experiments, much like the original **mongrelfolk** but with a more **Frankenstein-meets-Lovecraft** aesthetic.
- The **Church publicly disavows the asylum** but secretly funds it, sending those who "stray from the light" to **be corrected.**
- The **Church of the Eternal Light is tied to the Abbey** but **distances itself publicly** while **using it privately** for "correcting" enemies, failed clergy, and other "undesirables."
- The asylum is a **multi-story building** with parts **in decay**, others **actively in use**, and **hidden areas** where the worst horrors occur.
