### _(The City’s Edge, Industrial Graves)_

By far the largest district, **Krezk Valley is a city trying to escape itself.** On one end, its streets claw into the **deep forests** that **border the mist-choked outskirts**, while the other end stretches toward the **sea**, where vast **industrial warehouses loom over the coastline.**

The people here are **workers, hunters, and wanderers**—those who thrive on the edge of civilization. Factories belch **smoke into the sky**, their mechanical heartbeats reverberating through the valley. Meanwhile, closer to the forests, the **Church of the Eternal Light** holds sway, warning the populace of the _dangers lurking beyond the trees_.

- **Notable Locations:**
    - **The Seawall Slums** – A grim sprawl of **rusted shanties and warehouse-labor tenements** that floods whenever the tide rises.
    - **The Eastern Groves** – The last remnant of **untamed wilderness**, rumored to be home to strange creatures **that do not fear men**.
    - **The Iron Chapel** – A **monolithic church-factory**, where workers toil under the **watchful gaze of the clergy** in exchange for “redemption.”
- **Atmosphere:**
    - The constant **hum of industry** clashes with the stillness of the **ancient forest.**
    - The people are either **hardened industrial workers** or **superstitious villagers**, terrified of **what prowls beyond the valley’s edge.**
    - **Eerie blue lights** are sometimes seen flickering in the **distant treetops.**
