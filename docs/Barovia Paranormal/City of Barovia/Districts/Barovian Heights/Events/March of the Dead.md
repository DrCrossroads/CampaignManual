Every night at midnight, one hundred spirits rise from the [[The Cliffside Graveyard]] and march up the Old Svalich Road to [[The Lofts]].

>An eerie green light suffuses the graveyard. From this light emerges a ghostly procession. Wavering images of doughty women toting greatswords, woodwise men with slender bows, dwarves with glittering axes, and archaically dressed mages with beards and strange, pointed hats-all these and more march forth from the graveyard, their numbers growing by the second.

These aren't the spirits of the people buried here, but of various police officers and other people who died standing up to [[Strahd, Eldritch Lord of Barovia CR 13]]. Every night, the ghostly people attempt to complete their quest, and each night they fail. They have no interest in the living and can't be hit, damaged, or turned. They will not communicate with the characters.
**Once they reach the grounds outside the Lofts, the spirits disappear into mist.**
