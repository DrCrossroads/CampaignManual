## Descriptions
### _(The Old Quarter, The City's Cradle)_

Barovia Heights is the oldest part of the city, a place where history lingers in every cobblestone and shadowed alleyway. The streets are narrow and uneven, flanked by tall, **weathered brownstones and looming Gothic structures** that creak under their own weight. **Gas lamps flicker weakly**, often strangled by the omnipresent mist that seeps in from the **westward forests**. Time seems slower here, the air thick with the scent of **damp earth, old parchment, and decayed wood**.

The district houses **centuries-old townhouses, abandoned temples, and forgotten courtyards**, each whispering of a past that refuses to stay buried. At the center of Barovia Heights sits **The Hanging Square**, where rusted gallows stand as a grim reminder of the city's justice system from a bygone era.

- **Notable Locations:**
    - **The Warden's Rest** – A dimly lit, near-abandoned tavern where **the city's oldest ghosts** are said to drink alongside the living.
    - **The Hollow Archive** – An underground, candlelit archive holding records older than the city itself—some penned in languages no one can read.
    - **Whisperwood Park** – A long-neglected public garden where twisted oaks and gnarled willows form a **natural cathedral**, swallowing all light beneath them.
- **Atmosphere:**
    - Perpetual dampness, a **lingering fog**, and the eerie sensation of being **watched** by something just beyond the mist.
    - The streets are often **deserted** except for the occasional priest, historian, or **something far older**.
    - The **city's original noble families** still own homes here—though most lie **vacant, haunted, or cursed**.

### Haunts
- [[Generic Haunts]]
- **Whispers in the Fog**: Each night, a denser fog than normal rolls in, carrying whispers of lost souls. Those who listen too closely may be compelled to follow the voices, leading them to dark corners of the city where they encounter the spirits of the deceased, seeking help to resolve their unfinished business. These ghosts use charm person, Wis save DC 15 to lure others.
	- The fog rolls in, the fog rolls out,
	  But voices call, they scream, they shout.
	  Cover your ears, don’t heed their plea,
	  Or in the mist, lost you’ll be.
	  
	  The fog is thick, the night is long,
	  The voices hum a hollow song.
	  Step too near, and hold your breath—
	  One more step could mean your death.
	  
	  The fog rolls in, the streets grow still,
	  The whispers dance beyond the hill.
	  Step too close and hear them say,
	  "Come with us—you've lost your way."
	  
	  The fog rolls thick, the lamps burn dim,
	  A voice calls out—a child? A hymn?
	  It beckons sweet, it lures you near,
	  Step too close, and you disappear.
	  
	  For in the mist, the lost still tread,
	  Their lips are cold, their eyes are dead.
	  They reach, they pull, they whisper low—
	  "Come with us, to where none go."
	
- **Haunted Artifacts**: A local antiques shop houses a cursed object—a mirror that shows not reflections, but glimpses of the past. Each time a character looks into it, they witness a horrifying event that occurred in the city, revealing clues about a greater mystery.
