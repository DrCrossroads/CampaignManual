#### Description
>A moaning sob floats through the still, gray streets, coloring your thoughts with sadness. The sounds flow from a dark, two-story townhouse.

#### Important Information

Mad Mary is found in her daughter's room on the second floor, clutching a malformed doll. She hardly recognizes the presence of anyone in the room. She says nothing of players show anger, but talks haltingly if players talk gently.

Mary locked her daughter in the house, forbidding her to go outside since the death of Mary's husband when Gertrude was young, about 6. Gertrude, now a teenager broke out of the house a night or two prior and has not been seen since. Mary fear's the worst.

[[Gertrude]] can be found in [[The Lofts]].

The malformed doll has a strange leer and wears a sackcloth dress; it was Mary's when she was a child. It was made by [[Gadof Blinsky]]. Stitched into the hem of the dress is a frayed tag bearing the words "Is no Fun, Is No Blinsky!"
