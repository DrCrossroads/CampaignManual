- **Location**: An old, crumbling manor perched high on a cliff overlooking the churning sea below. The cliffs are jagged and steep, with sheer drops that lead to the rocks below, where the ocean crashes violently against the shore. The manor itself is slowly decaying, its once-grand architecture now marked by time and neglect.
- **Hauntings**: The manor is rumored to be haunted by the spirits of its former residents—an aristocratic family who died under mysterious circumstances. The wind howls through the broken windows, and sometimes, the soft strains of music can be heard coming from within the house, though no one has lived there for years. People who approach the manor often feel an oppressive weight in the air, and a feeling of being drawn towards the edge of the cliff as if something is calling them.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The family that once lived in the manor practiced dark rituals to maintain their power, including an illicit pact with a sea demon. The demon was bound by the cliffs and the sea, but with the family’s death, it has been freed, and it calls to anyone who dares venture near the cliffs. The spirits of the family are trapped, cursed to protect the demon’s resting place. Uncovering the family’s dark past might reveal the way to stop the demon before it claims more victims.

## Nursery Rhyme
A deal was made, a price was set,
A wish was granted, one regret.
A voice still calls beneath the sea,
"Come closer now, belong to me."

A knock at midnight, a door ajar,
Salt in the wind, a wish on a star.
They asked too much, they paid the fee,
Now the sea won’t set them free.

A deal was made, a price was set,
A wish was granted, one regret.
A voice still calls beneath the sea,
"Come closer now, belong to me."

A manor stands where none should be,
Its windows dark, its halls set free.
They made a pact in years now past,
The sea still calls, its grip still lasts.
One knock, one step, you’re in too deep,
The waves will claim what demons keep.

## **Overview**

Perched atop a sheer cliff, **Cliffside Manor** looms over the crashing waves, its once-proud walls now **scarred by time and the elements**. The manor’s grand façade is cracked and crumbling, with ivy crawling up its exterior like skeletal fingers grasping at a long-forgotten past. The **cliffs below are treacherous**, sharp rocks jutting from the churning sea, where the water crashes with a sound like a **howling beast**.

Legends say the **aristocratic family who once resided here met a grim fate**—some claim they **vanished overnight**, others whisper that their **bodies were found broken on the rocks below**, victims of an **unknown force**. The **wind sings through the manor’s hollow halls**, carrying with it **faint strains of music and voices** that should not be there.

Worse still, those who stand too close to the cliffs feel an **unexplainable pull**, a whisper in their mind **urging them forward**. Some say the **family made a pact** with a **sea demon**, binding it within the waves, its **prison held by the estate’s presence**. But with the manor’s decay, the seal is failing, and **the demon calls once more**.
