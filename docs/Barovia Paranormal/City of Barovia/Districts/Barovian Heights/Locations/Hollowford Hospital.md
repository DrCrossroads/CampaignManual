- **Location**: A small, abandoned hospital on the outskirts of the city. Once a highly respected medical facility, it was closed after an unsolved string of mysterious deaths among patients in the late 1910s.
- **Hauntings**: The souls of patients who died under suspicious circumstances linger. Their faces can sometimes be seen peering through the cracked windows. Occasionally, patients' cries and the sounds of wheeled gurneys can be heard at night, but there’s no one there.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: It’s said that the head doctor, an eccentric genius, conducted horrific experiments that were never properly documented. The ghosts of his patients seem to be trying to communicate the truth of what happened.

## Nursery Rhyme
Doctor, doctor, what went wrong?
They scream in pain, but not for long.
The halls are dark, the beds are bare,
Yet whispers drift upon the air.

The halls once bright, the beds once clean,
The doctors swore to heal unseen.
But walls hold secrets, walls hold lies,
And no one here gets out alive.
The doors will lock, the lights will fade,
The past is here—it never strayed.

Doctor, doctor, what went wrong?
They scream in pain, but not for long.
The halls are dark, the beds are bare,
Yet whispers drift upon the air.

Ticking hands, beeping light,
Doctors come in dead of night.
Whispered words, shadowed halls,
No one leaves these painted walls.

## **Overview:**  
Hollowford Hospital was once a shining beacon of medical advancement, known for its cutting-edge treatments. But in the late 1910s, an unusual number of patients began dying under unexplained circumstances. Whispers of unethical experiments conducted by **Dr. Victor Hargrave**, the head doctor, spread through the community, but no evidence was ever found. The hospital was shut down after several nurses vanished overnight. Today, it stands abandoned, its halls filled with restless spirits who seek to reveal the truth.

## **Key Locations & Haunting Manifestations**

### **5. The Morgue – Where the Truth Lies**

- **Paranormal Activity:**
    - The ghosts become **hostile**, trying to **stop the party from leaving** without the truth.
    - The spirit of a **failed experiment** still lingers here, a **grotesque amalgamation of organs and bones**, unable to find peace.

## **Encounters & Paranormal Investigation Mechanics**

### **Investigation Tools & Mechanics**

1. **Spirit Box:** Picking up electronic whispers that seem to form coherent phrases when used in the **Surgery Theatre** or **Morgue**.
2. **EMF Detector:** Spikes erratically near the **hidden lab**, suggesting something unnatural still lingers there.

- It is a fusion of **multiple bodies**, each face **crying out in agony** as it **lunges at the investigators**.
