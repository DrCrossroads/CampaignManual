### Introduction

Murder Manor is a standalone introductory adventure for a fantasy 1920s-inspired Curse of Strahd campaign. The adventure takes a party of 2nd-level characters and guides them through a terrifying, investigative horror experience, culminating in a battle that will elevate them to 4th level. The house is a twisted, shifting entity trapped in time, concealing an eldritch horror within its foundation. The players must unravel the manor's mystery while surviving its nightmarish inhabitants.

### Adventure Hook

The city of Barovia has long whispered of Blackwood Manor—an abandoned estate at the edge of town. Though uninhabited for years, reports of strange lights, distant cries, and a thick, unnatural fog have drawn the attention of local journalists and thrill-seekers. One such investigator, **Joshua Arbole**, a detective from *The Gargoyle's Dawn*, recently vanished after claiming to have uncovered a terrifying truth about the manor. **Kenneth Eastwood**, desperate for answers, has enlisted the party to locate Joshua and document the manor’s secrets.

### Background

Blackwood Manor was once the home of the Becker family, aristocrats with an affinity for the occult. Their obsession led them to conduct esoteric rituals in an attempt to commune with higher beings, unknowingly calling forth an entity from beyond the veil. This entity, **The Hunger of Mottled Flesh**, now haunts the manor, warping time and reality. The Beckers themselves became part of the house—some as lingering spirits, others as horrors stitched into its very walls.

## **Entering the Manor**

As the players approach the manor, the cityscape behind them dims, and the fog thickens. The manor stands in eerie silence, its iron gates creaking open at their approach. The front doors are unlocked but resistant, as if something inside is reluctant to let them pass.

**Supernatural Occurrences:**
- The air is thick with an unnatural stillness.
- The scent of sea salt and decay lingers.
- Shadows seem to move when not directly observed.

> _The manor looms over you like a tombstone beneath a storm-lit sky. Its iron gate creaks open on its own, beckoning you forward. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decay. The moment you step forward, the wind dies entirely, leaving only the sound of your own breath and the distant echo of something moving within the house._

Once inside, the doors slam shut behind them with an audible click. From this moment on, they are trapped until they uncover the truth and break the manor’s hold.

## **First Floor: The Investigation Begins**
The first floor serves as the players’ introduction to the horrors within Blackwood Manor. The house is aware of their presence, subtly shifting reality to disorient and manipulate them. The players will rely on their paranormal investigation equipment to uncover secrets and survive spectral encounters.

### **The Grand Foyer (Formerly Entrance & Main Hall)**

A towering chandelier flickers erratically, casting elongated shadows. A grand mirror stands cracked, distorting reflections into ghastly shapes. The air carries the scent of mildew and decay.
- **Supernatural Activity:**
    - The players' reflections occasionally linger after they move.
    - A successful DC 13 Perception check reveals faint footprints in the dust, leading deeper inside.
    - EMF readers spike near the mirror, detecting residual energy from past rituals. A person with no face reflects back at the players.

### **The Parlor (Formerly Den of Wolves)**

A phonograph sits in the corner, playing a warped recording of children's laughter in reverse. The room is adorned with decayed furniture and dust-covered portraits.

- **Encounter:** As the players inspect the phonograph, the stuffed animals in the room twitch and turn their heads. A sudden burst of static from the phonograph causes them to animate into spectral wolves (use Shadow stats but with a spectral bite attack). The players can use the **Spirit Box** to subdue them by communicating with the lingering spirits.

### **The Dining Room (Formerly Dining Room)**

A long mahogany table is set with pristine silverware and crystalware, but the food has rotted into black sludge. A faint, rhythmic tapping echoes from within the walls.

- **Supernatural Activity:**
	- A failed **Sanity Save (DC 12)** results in a temporary hallucination where the players see themselves seated at the table, laughing, as shadows loom behind them.
    - A successful DC 12 Investigation check reveals that touching the wrong piece of silverware triggers **spectral hands** to lash out (use Specter stats but unable to move).
    - A **Spectral Lens** scan shows shadowy figures reenacting a long-forgotten meal.

### **The Study (Formerly Hunter’s Den)**

The bookshelves are filled with occult tomes, many detailing rituals performed by the Becker family. A safe, hidden behind a bookshelf, contains **Joshua Arbole’s notes**, covered in frantic warnings: “It watches. It waits. We are all its feast.”

- **Puzzle:** **The Silver Key**
    - The safe requires a silver key, hidden in the **dining room’s centerpiece**.
    - If players search the wrong silverware, they trigger an angry spirit attack.
    - The **Eldritch Tuning Fork** resonates near the correct location.

### **The Kitchen (Formerly Kitchen & Pantry)**

The stove remains lit, though the flames produce no heat. The pantry shelves are fully stocked, yet the food turns to ash when touched.

- **Supernatural Activity:**
    - A **butcher’s knife** hovers for a moment before clattering to the ground.
    - The **Spirit Box** picks up a child’s voice whispering, “Don’t eat the food.”

### **The Hidden Trapdoor (Formerly Secret Trapdoor)**

A section of the floor in the kitchen creaks unnaturally. A successful DC 15 Investigation check reveals a **trapdoor**, but it cannot be opened until players encounter the basement’s horrors from below.

### **The Dumbwaiter (Formerly Dumbwaiter)**

A small service elevator connects the kitchen to the second and third floors. Their is a small shelf, connected to a rope-and-pully that's open at the top. Anyone peering up the shaft can only see darkness. A **brass bell** dangles beside it, attached by wires leading upwards.

- **Supernatural Activity:** If players ring the bell, they hear frantic knocking from the second floor, followed by heavy footsteps approaching but never arriving.

---

### **First Floor Encounter: The Whispering Maid**

- **Description:** A spectral maid, her face half-obscured by shadows, lingers in the grand foyer, dusting furniture that is not there.

- **Mechanic:**
    
    - If approached, she vanishes and reappears behind a player, whispering warnings in an unknown language.
    - Players can use the **Spirit Box** to translate her message: “The house feeds. It watches. It will let you leave if you give it what it wants.”
    - If ignored, she eventually lets out a **piercing wail** (DC 13 Wisdom save or take 2d6 psychic damage).

---

## Second Floor

As the investigators ascend to the second floor, the corruption of the manor grows more apparent. The Becker family’s dark past seeps through the walls, and glimpses of their madness become unavoidable. The horrors here are more pronounced, and the eldritch presence within the house begins to assert itself more aggressively.

### **Upper Hall**

A grand hallway lined with portraits of the Becker family, their faces distorted as if painted over by something unnatural. The air is thick with an overwhelming sense of being watched.

- **Paranormal Event**: The portraits shift when unobserved, their eyes following the players. If closely examined, one painting shows a shadowy figure standing behind the party.
- **Clue**: A small bloodstain near the servant’s room door suggests a struggle.

### **Servant’s Room**

A cramped room containing two small beds, a single wardrobe, and a writing desk covered in dust.

- **Clue**: A letter from a frightened servant detailing strange rituals conducted by the Beckers. Mentions "the voices beyond the veil" and a growing fear of Lady Becker’s nightly summonings.
- **Paranormal Equipment**: EVP devices pick up distant, whispered prayers. A voice whispers, _"He left, but I stayed. Someone must always stay."_
- **Encounter**: If the players remain too long, a spectral servant appears, begging them to leave before it violently dissipates.

### **Dumbwaiter**

A small, claustrophobic shaft leading to the kitchen below. The metal inside is ice-cold to the touch.

- **Paranormal Event**: If the players looked up the dumbwaiter in the floor below, anyone peering down sees a twisted reflection of themselves staring back, before the vision vanishes.
- **Utility**: Can be used to send objects between floors, though something unknown occasionally sends items back.

### **Library**

A vast collection of rotting tomes and occult texts, with a grand fireplace that smolders despite no visible source of fuel.

- **Puzzle**: A specific passage in "The Becker Journals" details how music was used to appease their "benefactor." This ties into the Concert Hall encounter.
- **Clue**: A secret compartment in the desk contains a tattered letter from **Strahd von Zarovich**, warning the cult against their misguided worship of an Elder God.  
- **Paranormal Event**: Books fly from the shelves, stacking themselves into unreadable sigils before collapsing into dust.

#### The Letter from Strahd

> _To the misguided souls of the Becker House,_
> _You toy with forces you cannot comprehend. You whisper to something that neither hears nor cares, yet you believe it will grant you power. You are wrong._
> _It does not give. It only takes._
> _Should you continue, you will call down not divinity, but ruin. Do not mistake my restraint for mercy, for I alone know the price of what lurks beyond the veil._
> _You are but moths to a flame. And I will not shield you when it consumes you._
> _S. von Zarovich_

### **Secret Room**

A hidden chamber behind a false bookcase, containing ritual artifacts and Becker family relics.

- **Clue**: A blackened altar with symbols carved into the stone, linking the family to an ancient sea cult.
- **Encounter**: Touching the altar forces a **Sanity Save (DC 14)**. Failure results in a brief vision of the cultists merging together into something unspeakable.

### **Concert Hall (Formerly the Conservatory)**

A grand room filled with decayed instruments, dominated by an antique piano covered in claw marks. The sheet music on the stand is stained with blood.

- **Puzzle**: The correct sequence must be played to trigger a hidden compartment, revealing an **occult dagger** used in the Becker sacrifices. The notes can be found in the Library.
- **Paranormal Event**: When the puzzle is activated, a ghostly figure sits at the piano and plays a discordant melody before vanishing.
- **Encounter**: If the wrong notes are played, the piano emits a deafening screech, forcing a **Constitution Save (DC 13)** to avoid temporary deafness.
---

## **Third Floor

### **Balcony (Formerly Balcony)**

A dust-choked balcony overlooks the foyer below. A suit of blackened, rusted armor stands motionless, cobwebs clinging to its form.

- **Supernatural Event**: As the party approaches, the armor’s helmet turns slightly, as if watching them. If disturbed, it animates and attacks.
- **Environmental Detail**: The wood-paneled walls feature intricate carvings of trees and wildlife. A **DC 12 Perception** check reveals subtle, horrific details—tiny corpses among the branches, worms writhing in the carved soil.
- **Secret Passage**: A **DC 15 Perception** check reveals a hidden door in the west wall, leading to a dust-laden staircase spiraling up to the attic.

---

### **Master Bedroom (Formerly Master Suite)**

A once-luxurious bedroom, now ruined by deep claw marks on the walls and furniture. The bed is shredded, the fabric stained dark.

- **The Becker Journals, Vol. 2**: Found on the nightstand, it details grotesque nightmares and a ritual to “awaken the hunger.”
- **Paranormal Event**: The vanity mirror distorts, showing the reflection of a man clawing at his own face.
- **Investigation (DC 15)**: A hidden compartment in the wardrobe contains a **ceremonial dagger encrusted with barnacle-like growths**.

---

### **Locked Study (Formerly Storage Room)**

A small study filled with scattered books. The air pulses as if the room is breathing.

- **Joshua Arbole’s Notes**: His lantern and notebook lie near the desk, the final entry reading: "The walls are listening. The hunger stirs."
- **Paranormal Event**: The walls briefly turn into fleshy masses, twitching and sighing before solidifying again.
- **Puzzle: The Whispering Books** – Several books hum faintly. Arranging them in the correct order (**DC 14 Intelligence**) causes the bookshelf to slide open, revealing a hidden area with some treasures and occult objects.

---

### **Bathing Chamber (Formerly Bathroom)**

This dark room contains a claw-footed tub, an iron stove, and a broken spigot. The air is thick with the scent of salt and rot.

- **Paranormal Event**: Filling the tub with water causes hands to emerge from beneath, grasping at anything nearby before vanishing.
- **Clue**: Scratched into the stove’s surface: "Drown the past, and it shall speak."

---

### **Nursemaid’s Quarters (Formerly Nursemaid’s Suite)**

Dust and cobwebs cover an elegantly furnished bedroom. The adjoining nursery is shrouded in unnatural darkness.

- **Specter Encounter**: The nursemaid’s spirit lingers, appearing as a skeletal woman with hollow eyes. If the players open the nursery door, she manifests and attacks.
- **Mirror Clue**: A full-length mirror has an ornate frame carved with ivy and berries. **DC 12 Perception** reveals hidden eyes among the carvings. The mirror conceals a **secret door**.
- **Nursery Horror**: The crib is covered by a black shroud. Pulling it back reveals a baby-sized bundle. If unwrapped, it is empty.

---

### **Secret Passage (Formerly Secret Door)**

Behind the mirror in the Nursemaid’s Quarters is a narrow, cobweb-filled staircase leading up to the attic.

- **Environmental Detail**: The walls appear **wet and pulsating** when viewed through spectral lenses.
- **Whispering Voices**: Faint echoes of the Becker family's final moments play as the party ascends.
---

## **Murder Manor: Fourth Floor – The Attic**

The fourth floor of Murder Manor is a decaying attic filled with the remnants of its former inhabitants. Dust and cobwebs choke the air, and an eerie silence pervades, broken only by the occasional whisper of something unseen. Here, the players will uncover the tragic fate of the Becker children, solve paranormal puzzles, and confront a lingering specter.

---

### **Attic Hall**

This long, narrow hallway is filled with old crates, moth-eaten drapes, and broken furniture. The wooden floor creaks with every step, and shadows seem to stretch unnaturally along the walls.

**Locked Door:** One of the doors is sealed with a rusted padlock (DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves’ tools to unlock). The key is hidden in the library on the second floor.

**Madeline’s Presence:** Madeline, the vengeful specter, roams the attic unseen. The party can hear her muttering and screaming about "naughty children" and their need for punishment. Doors slam shut and open, but no source is visible.
- **Paranormal Equipment Interaction:** Using ghost-detecting tools can reveal flickering readings where she is present.
- **Sanity Checks:** Prolonged exposure to her voice requires DC 13 Wisdom saves to avoid temporary paranoia.
- **Combat Trigger:** If a player moves too close to her unseen location, she attacks, though she remains invisible.

---

### **Servant’s Quarters (Formerly the Spare Bedroom)**

A modest room with a small iron stove, a writing desk, and an empty wardrobe. A delicate porcelain doll in a faded yellow dress sits in a rocking chair, draped in cobwebs.

**Paranormal Event:** If the party lingers, the doll's head slowly turns to face them, whispering in an unknown language.

---

### **Storage Room**

A cramped space packed with abandoned furniture, mannequins, and dusty trunks. Among the clutter, an unlocked wooden trunk contains the skeletal remains of **Madeline, the Becker family's nursemaid**, wrapped in a bloodstained sheet.

**Paranormal Event:** The dollhouse (see below) reveals where Madeline is moving in real-time. Players can use this to track her location.

**Combat Mechanic:** Once the players use the dollhouse to track her, Madeline becomes visible and vulnerable to attacks.

**Madeline’s Specter (CR 3) – Statblock Included Below**

---

### **Children’s Room (Formerly Nursery)**

This room is filled with broken and scattered toys, some appearing freshly used despite decades of decay. The bricked-up window and heavy silence suggest a terrible past. In the center of the room lie two small skeletons, their tattered clothing eerily familiar.

- **Clue:** A child’s drawing on the wall depicts a monstrous figure beneath the house.
- **Paranormal Event:** A rocking horse moves on its own.
- **Puzzle: The Dollhouse Connection** – A miniature replica of Blackwood Manor, complete with tiny dolls representing its former inhabitants, sits in the room. One doll moves on its own, mimicking Madeline’s unseen presence in real-time.

**Dollhouse Puzzle Mechanics:**
- **Tracking Madeline:** By watching the doll, players can pinpoint where Madeline is in the attic.
- **Unlocking the Secret Stairs:** Opening the tiny secret door in the dollhouse automatically reveals the real secret passage.

**The Becker Children’s Ghosts** If the party disturbs the dollhouse or toy chest, the ghosts of **Eleanor and Peter Becker** manifest. They are frightened and reluctant to speak, but reveal:

- Their parents locked them in to “protect them from the monster.”
- The secret entrance to the basement can be found by examining the dollhouse.

##### **Eleanor & Peter Becker (Ghost Children) – Statblock Included Below**

- The ghosts can be laid to rest by placing their remains in the family crypt.

---

### **Secret Stairs**

A hidden door in the east wall of the attic reveals a narrow spiral staircase descending into darkness. Thick cobwebs limit visibility to 5 feet. The stairs lead directly to **Dungeon Level Access**, where the final horrors of the manor await.
- **Unlocking Mechanism:** The stairs are revealed only when the secret door in the dollhouse is opened.

---

---

### **Conclusion**

- Players can lay the children’s ghosts to rest by burying their remains in the crypt.
- Defeating Madeline’s Specter grants **a worn locket** containing a cryptic message about the ritual below.
	-  _"Beneath the house, the circle remains unbroken. Blood calls to the earth, and the whispering void stirs. Only the innocent may silence the chant. Only the forsaken may bar the gate. Beware the price of the last breath."_
		This message hints at how to stop the ritual below:
		- "The circle remains unbroken" suggests that the ritual is still active.
		- "Blood calls to the earth" could imply a blood sacrifice is part of the ritual.
		- "Only the innocent may silence the chant" may mean that a child's remains (perhaps Eleanor and Peter’s) must be used in some way to halt the ritual.
		- "Only the forsaken may bar the gate" suggests that a lost or forgotten soul (potentially Madeline) could play a role in sealing whatever is awakening.
		- "Beware the price of the last breath" warns of a cost—perhaps a soul must be willingly sacrificed to stop the ritual.
- The secret stairs lead directly to the **Dungeon Level**, where the final horror of Murder Manor awaits.
- The Party levels up to Level 3

## Murder Manor - Basement Level 1

### General Features

The air in the basement is thick with damp earth and something else—something wrong. The scent of iron lingers, and every footstep sends echoes bouncing down the tight corridors. The walls, roughly hewn from stone and dirt, seem to pulse in the dim lantern light, as if alive. Timber braces groan under the weight of the house above, and the oppressive sense of being watched never fades.

- **Ceiling Height**: The tunnels are 7 feet tall, but the rooms reach up to 8 feet, except for the **Reliquary**, which is a cavernous 16 feet high.
- **Light**: Complete darkness. Players must bring their own light sources.

- **Encounter**: **Hollow Children** emerge from the alcoves, silent and watching.

- **Encounter**: **Flesh Leeches** drop from the ceiling, hungry for new hosts.

## Murder Manor - Basement Level 2

#### General Features

Descending the final steps, the air grows heavier, thick with the scent of decay and something more insidious—an oily presence that clings to the skin. The walls, rough-hewn and damp, pulse faintly with unnatural energy. Faint whispers slither through the darkness, remnants of the past lingering in the stones.

- **Ceiling Height**: Ranges between 7 and 10 feet, with the **Forgotten Chamber** opening into a cavernous void.
- **Light**: Absolute darkness. Shadows seem deeper, stretching unnaturally.
- **Paranormal Influence**: Reality shifts unpredictably—footsteps echo twice, doors lead to places they shouldn’t, and sometimes, the walls _breathe_.

### Encounters & Challenges

#### **[[CR2 Void-Stained Witness]]**
- Theo Becker. Tattered, ripped suit. Monocle dangling, swinging from chain.

#### **The Hunger of Mottled Flesh (Final Boss)**

A writhing mass of mouths, limbs, and stolen memories, this abomination feeds on the souls of those who perish within the manor. It manipulates the environment, warps perception, and vanishes into darkness to strike from unseen angles.

- **Psychic Torment**: Players may be forced to relive the last moments of past victims.
- **Reality Warping**: Doors shift unpredictably, and floorboards may open into the abyss.
- **Weakness**: Destroying the original cult sigils carved into the foundation severs its link to the house.
    - **Arcana (DC 16)** or **Religion (DC 14)** can weaken it before battle.

## Rooms & Features

### **The Reliquary of Shattered Faith (Formerly Reliquary)**

Rows of rusted shelves hold cracked urns and broken relics. The air hums with residual power, tainted by misuse.
- **Paranormal Equipment**: Spirit Box crackles with distorted prayers.
- **Loot**: _Tainted Chalice_ (drinking from it grants dark visions, hinting at the cult’s endgame).

### **The Forgotten Cells (Formerly Prison)**

Rusting iron bars enclose shadowed alcoves, where skeletal remains grasp at freedom they never found. Some walls bear deep gouges, as if something inside was trying to escape _out_.
- **Haunted Shadows**: Players may glimpse reflections of themselves trapped behind the bars.
- **Whispers**: A **ghostly voice** whispers a question: _"Who will stay?"_
- **Loot**: _Iron-Bound Grimoire_ (details rituals used to bind the Hunger of Mottled Flesh).
	- The Iron-Bound Grimoire speaks of a _Watcher Beyond the Stars_, whose influence still seeps into the cracks of reality.
- **Escape Route**: One cell contains a collapsed tunnel leading deeper into the ruins.

### **The Cradle of Devouring Light (Formerly Portcullis)**

A circular chamber lined with faded sigils, its floor inlaid with veins of blackened silver. The air vibrates with an unseen force.
- **Puzzle**: Players must reactivate the warding sigils to weaken the Hunger before entering the final chamber.
- **Paranormal Equipment**: Light reveals hidden warnings scrawled in blood.
- **Clue**: _“The door is a wound. The wound must be sealed.”_

### **The Forgotten Chamber (Formerly Ritual Chamber)**

A vast, cavernous void pulsating with shifting darkness. The remnants of an ancient ritual circle are inscribed into the foundation, carved deep into the stone. In the center writhes the **Hunger of Mottled Flesh**.

- **Terrain Hazards**:
    - Pools of shifting black ichor that pull victims in.
    - Flickering visions of past cultists, their screams echoing through time.
- **Paranormal Equipment**: EMF readers spike erratically, maxing out in the presence of the Hunger.
- **Resolution**:
    - Perform the **Banishment Ritual** (requires components found in other rooms).
    - Destroy the **Cult Sigils**, severing its tether.
    - Face the Hunger in direct combat.

## Endings & Escape

##### **The Collapse of Reality**

_Triggered when the players burn the sigils and sever the Hunger’s connection to the house._

- **Sealing the Hunger**: The manor shudders as the sigils are burned away. The house collapses, leaving only a scar upon the land. If the ritual fails, the manor itself begins to consume reality, forcing the players to escape before they are trapped forever.

**General Setup:**

- Once the final sigil is destroyed, the entire house begins to _consume itself._ The walls ripple, furniture melts into flesh, and the architecture warps unpredictably.
- The party has a limited **real-time** window (e.g., **10-15 minutes**) to escape before they are swallowed into oblivion.
- Each **5-minute increment** causes new reality-bending hazards to occur.

---

##### **The Escape Route:**

The players must navigate their way back to the surface. However, **the layout is no longer the same.**

- Rooms they previously passed through now loop in on themselves or lead to impossible places.
- Some doors no longer function—**they open into voids, walls, or worse, into the house’s “stomach.”**
- Shadows of past victims **try to mislead them, offering false exits.**

---

##### **Reality-Warping Escape Hazards**

📌 **At the start of the escape:** The entire house distorts—stairs lead to ceilings, doors open into the same rooms, and time seems inconsistent. The players will need to rely on their **paranormal equipment** to find the correct path.

⏳ **After 5 minutes (real-time): The House Rearranges**

- Rooms shift suddenly. A hallway that once led to the exit now loops back to the basement.
- **Check**: Players must find **the correct route using EVP signals, EMF spikes, or sigil patterns left behind.**
- **Consequence:** If they go the wrong way, they lose **precious time** as they end up deeper inside the house.

⏳ **After 10 minutes: The Flesh Gates Appear**

- The manor begins birthing **flesh-like doorways**, pulsating and whispering names.
- Some are real exits. Others lead to **digestive chambers** where past victims are still trapped.
- **Check**: Perception/Investigation DC 15 or use UV light to reveal the right passage.
- **Consequence:** If they step through the wrong door, they are **grabbed by screaming tendrils** and must escape via Strength (DC 14) or Dexterity (DC 15).

⏳ **After 15 minutes: The Grand Devourer Wakes**

- A _final chase sequence_ begins as the **heart of the house manifests—a colossal, fleshy vortex sucking in all reality.**
- Players must **run, dodge, and resist getting pulled into the abyss.**
- The final doorway flickers between **three different realities**, and they must pick one.
    - Only **one leads to safety** (requires a check or intuition).
    - The others deposit them **elsewhere**—perhaps deeper into a **parallel nightmare version of the city.**

🎭 **Final Moment:** As the last survivor leaps through, the house **implodes into itself**, leaving behind nothing but a burned-out ruin.

#### **The Manor’s Curse Lingers**

_The house is not truly dead—it just needs a new anchor._

- **The Manor’s Curse Lingers**: If the Hunger is merely wounded, the manor remains, and its influence spreads, leading the players deeper into the city’s secrets.

Instead of destroying the sigils, the players can **sacrifice something** to bind the house’s existence to the material world.

##### **What Can They Sacrifice?**

1. **A Willing Soul** – Someone must **willingly stay behind**, becoming the new "Keeper" of the house. They will **never leave, but they will hold the Hunger at bay.**
    - A PC can **choose to take on the burden**, leaving a part of them behind forever in the echoes of the house.
2. **A Memory That Matters** – Instead of a life, the house will take **a core piece of the player’s soul.**
    - **Players:**
        - **Erase their own identity**—when they leave, they no longer remember who they are.
        - **Sacrifice their strongest skill** (mechanically, they permanently lose proficiency in a major skill or ability).

- This is an **investment for the future**—the players now have another mystery to solve later.

### **Outcome:**

- If the sacrifice is accepted, the house **stabilizes** instead of collapsing.
- The players can leave **safely,** but **the manor remains**, waiting for new victims.
- Paranormal investigators will **still hear whispers** from within.

🎭 **Final Scene:**  
As the players walk away, they hear **a familiar voice**—someone they know **but shouldn’t be inside the house.** The doors **shut permanently behind them**, trapping the new sacrifice inside.

---

### **Larger Mystery Hooks**

- The Iron-Bound Grimoire speaks of a _Watcher Beyond the Stars_, whose influence still seeps into the cracks of reality.

The house may fall, but its secrets remain. What was started here was merely a glimpse of the horror awaiting beyond.
