- **Location**: An isolated, weather-worn cemetery located at the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea. The graves are old and unkempt, with many stones crumbling into the earth, making the place appear forgotten and abandoned. The crashing waves below seem to drown out all sound, adding to the eerie silence of the graveyard.
- **Hauntings**: The wind whispers through the cemetery, carrying with it the faint, mournful sound of ghostly voices. Occasionally, a faint, glowing light appears near one of the graves, leading some to believe it’s the restless spirit of the dead rising. People who venture too close to the edge of the cliff are often overcome by an unnatural compulsion to jump into the sea, as though they are being beckoned by a spectral force. Several have disappeared without a trace, their bodies never found.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The cemetery is said to be the final resting place of those who were involved in a long-forgotten tragedy at sea—victims of a shipwreck whose spirits are bound to the cliff. Their restless souls are not at peace, and some believe that an ancient curse hangs over the graveyard, pulling the living into the waters below. Investigating the cemetery might reveal the tragic history and offer a chance to break the curse, though it may require a dangerous sacrifice.

## Nursery Rhyme
A tombstone stands, a name worn thin,
The sea calls out, it pulls you in.
The ones who walked too near the edge,
Are sleeping now beneath the ledge.

The waves do call, the graves do weep,
The cliffs hold secrets buried deep.
A name once whispered on the tide,
Now lost where restless spirits hide.

The waves crash high, the headstones lean,
A hundred names no longer seen.
Their voices rise in salted mist,
A whispered tale, a fleeting tryst.
Step too close, the earth may slide,
And down you’ll go—no time to hide.

The waves do call, the graves do weep,
The cliffs hold secrets buried deep.
A name once whispered on the tide,
Now lost where restless spirits hide.

>A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.

Every night at midnight a ghostly procession takes place (see [[March of the Dead]]).
