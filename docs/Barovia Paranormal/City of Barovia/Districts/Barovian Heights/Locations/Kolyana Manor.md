_A fading symbol of old power, where shadows cling to the past and secrets lurk in the walls._

#### **Overview**

The **Kolyana Manor** is a two-story mansion that once embodied the wealth and status of the **Kolyana crime family**. Once grand, it has fallen into **disrepair**, its walls bearing the scars of both **time and betrayal**. The **recent death of Izmark Kolyana III** has left the family in turmoil, and his wake draws both allies and vultures eager to claim his legacy.

The **mansion is dimly lit**, its **chandeliers dusty**, its **wooden floors warped with age**. **Cigarette smoke** lingers in the halls, mingling with the scent of **old whiskey, damp wood, and fading perfumes**.

#### **Event: The Wake of Izmark Kolyana III**

When the players first arrive, the **wake** is in progress. The **parlor is filled with mourners**, **low conversation**, and **a subtle tension** as factions within the Kolyana family maneuver for dominance. The **coffin sits in the Grand Foyer**, surrounded by **black candles and white lilies**, his **aged face barely touched by death**.

**Notable NPCs in Attendance:**

- **[[Ireena Kolyana]] (LN, Human, “Izmark’s Daughter”)** – Holds her father’s hand in silent grief. She does not trust the men now circling the family.
- **Sergei Kolyana (LE, Human, “The Heir Apparent”)** – Izmark’s **ruthless nephew**, already **positioning himself as the new head**.
- **Father Gregor (LN, Human, “The Crooked Priest”)** – **Performing the rites**, but **clearly uncomfortable** with the guests.
- **Tomas Vargo (NE, Half-Orc, “The Debt Collector”)** – Represents the **debtors** who now come to collect what Izmark owed.
