- Parpol "[[Parriwimple]]" Cantemir - Stockboy

##### Description
The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn, heavy curtains. A lighted sign in the window reads "Bildrath's."

#### Important Information
Bildrath is happy to make a profit from anyone. He serves his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains since, as he says, "If you want it badly enough, you'll pay for it."
If the players give Bildrath a hard time, he calls Parriwimple, his nephew and stockboy. Perriwimple has the statistics of a gladiator with Intelligence 6 and no shield (AC14). Parriwimple's real name is Parpol Cantemir. His muscles rippling beneath his dirty and wrinkled dress shirt give ample notice of his strength. He wears a muted color bowtie and a dented bowler hat. He is devoted to his uncle and will not follow the players as long as Bildrath has something to say about it.
