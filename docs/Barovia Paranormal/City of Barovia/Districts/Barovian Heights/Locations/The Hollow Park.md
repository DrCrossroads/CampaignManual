- **Location**: Once a lush, beautiful park in the city center, now left to rot. Overgrown trees and unkempt hedges hide the old bandstand and playground. Strange things have been happening lately: people go missing after walking through its gates.
- **Hauntings**: The park is rumored to be built on an old burial ground. Visitors often feel a presence lurking behind them, and children’s laughter can be heard even when no one is around. There have been reports of shadowy figures in the trees and strange, dark shapes in the water of the old pond.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: A cult used the park for occult gatherings before the city took it over. Its spirits are restless, and the park may be the source of the town's slow descent into madness.

## Nursery Rhyme
They built the swings, they paved the way,
Yet none dare come, none dare stay.
A hush of leaves, a fleeting shade—
A game is played but never made.
Laughter lingers, cold and thin,
A ghostly game you cannot win.

Leaves rustle, branches creak,
A shadow lingers, tall and meek.
Turn too fast, it disappears,
Turn too slow, it’s in your ear.

Push the swing, but don’t look back,
Footsteps follow, shadows black.
Run too slow, you’ll hear them say,
"Stay and play, stay and play."

## **Overview**

Once a cherished green space at the heart of the city, **Hollow Park** has fallen into eerie disrepair. The trees stand unnaturally tall, their twisted branches forming claw-like silhouettes against the sky. The overgrown paths are lined with forgotten benches, their wood rotting and splintered. The **bandstand**, once home to lively performances, now stands eerily silent, and the **playground**, covered in rust and decay, sways in the wind despite the air being unnervingly still.

Lately, people have **gone missing**, vanishing without a trace after stepping through its gates. Those who enter at night report **whispers from the trees**, laughter with no source, and the chilling feeling of being watched.

The park was **built over an ancient burial ground**, but worse still, **a cult once used it for rituals**, leaving behind remnants of their dark gatherings. Their spirits remain **trapped**, their **unfinished rites bleeding into reality**, twisting the park into a liminal space between the living and the dead.
