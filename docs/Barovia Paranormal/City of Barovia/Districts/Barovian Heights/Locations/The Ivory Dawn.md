#### Description
>Atop a slight rise, against the roots of a pillar that supports the immense wall that surrounds the Lofts, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and the soft glow of light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load.

##### Events
If your card reading reveals that a treasure is in the undercroft, it's contained in a moldy, old chest in the southwest corner of the room. The chest is unlocked and not trapped.

#### Important Information
If the characters approach the church doors, add:

>The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.

The village priest, Donavich, lives here. Those that live near the church shun the building for reasons that will quickly become obvious. The following areas correspond to labels on the map of the church.

![[Pasted image 20241026201322.png]]

##### A. Hall
>The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent rooms. You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Suddenly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.

The scream comes from the church's undercroft (area g). The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to Donavich, the priest (see area f).

##### B. Doru's Bedroom
>This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with an old mattress. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden holy symbol.

This room once belonged to Doru, Donavich's son, who is trapped in the basement (area g). It hasn't been used in more than a year and contains nothing of value.

##### C. Donavich's Bedroom
>This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a tidied mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.

This is Donavich's room and contains nothing of value.

##### D. Office
>An old desk and chair stand against the north wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them-a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the south wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.

An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank paper, along with a couple of pens. For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little. Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: Hymns to the Dawn, a volume of chants to the Morninglord, and The Blade of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.

##### E. Stairs
>Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. around the corner of a half-wall is a set of rickety looking stairs leading down to a basement. A young man's screams of anguish can be heard louder than ever.

##### F. Chapel
>The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Lightbulbs added in random locations around the broken rafters light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.

If the characters have not already entered the basement, add:
>From beneath the chapel floor, you hear a young man's voice cry out, "Father! I'm starving!"

Donavich has been praying throughout the night. His voice is hoarse and weak. He is, in a word, insane. A little more than a year ago, his twenty-year-old son Doru and several of his friends went to the Raven Lofts hoping to join the von Zarovich crime family, having been lured there by by some of Don von Zarovich's gangsters with promises of money and prestige.  Doru's friends did not return, but Doru returned to his father as a vampire spawn. Donavich, believing his son was posessed by a demon, was able to trap his son in the church's basement, where he remains to this day. Doru hasn't fed since he was imprisoned, and he cries out to his father at all hours. Meanwhile, Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how to save Doru without destroying him. If the characters seem intent on slaying Doru, Donavich does his best to stop them. If Doru dies, Donavich falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair. 
**Donavich knows the following useful information:**
- Ireena Kolyana isn't the natural daughter of Ismark Kolyana III. Although Ireena never knew, Ismark found her at the edge of the Svalich Forest near the east of Barovian Heights. She was but a girl then and seemed to have no memory of her past. Ismark adopted her and loved her dearly.
- Every night at midnight, the spirits of dead adventurers rise up out of the church graveyard, forming a silent procession as they walk the road toward the Raven Lofts.

###### Funeral for Ismark III
If the characters bring Ismark Kolyana III's body to the church, Donavich presses the characters into helping him bury the man in the cemetery at dawn. During the burial, Donavich offers prayers to the Morninglord in exchange for Ismark Kolyana III's deliverance
from Barovia.
Once Ismark is put in the ground, Donavich agrees with Ismark IV and pushes that the characters take Ireena to another district where she can start fresh. He proposes that the characters take her to the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk Valley (chapter 8) for there, she can visit the hospital or asylum for help. Donavich is unaware that the abbey, once a bastion of good, has become a den of evil.
