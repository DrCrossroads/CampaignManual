_"Knowledge is power, and power is never free."_

A **secret store beneath the library**, filled with **forbidden tomes, lost manuscripts, and occult relics**. The **Archivist**â€”a reclusive, **masked figure**â€”deals in **knowledge too dangerous for public consumption**. Some say they were once a professor; others claim **theyâ€™ve always been here**.

ðŸ”¹ **Description**
- Always seen in a **dark academic robe and an expressionless mask**â€”some claim **there is nothing beneath it**.
- Their **voice changes**, sometimes **calm and scholarly**, sometimes **echoing with multiple tones**.
- The Vault **moves locations**â€”only those with the right knowledge **can find the entrance**.

ðŸ”¹ **How They Operate**
- The **cost of knowledge is knowledge**â€”instead of money, the Archivist **demands secrets, research, or artifacts**.
- Some books **cannot be read without consequence**â€”**sanity slips, eyes bleed, whispers follow**.
- The Archivist **never lies**, but they never give **the full truth** either.

ðŸ”¹ **What They Sell**
- **Tomes of eldritch knowledge**â€”spells, prophecies, and **forbidden history**.
- **Sealed letters from the dead**â€”messages from the **departed**, but **at what cost?**
- **Maps to hidden places**â€”some lead to treasure, others to **things that should remain buried**.

ðŸ”¹ **Potential Hooks**
- A student **vanished after a meeting with the Archivist**, leaving behind **a book that bleeds**.
- The Vault **has moved**, and **someone is desperate to find it**â€”but why?
- The Archivist offers the party **an old, cursed manuscript**, but **its last reader went mad**.
