>Tucked behind the citadel is a fog-shrouded cemetery enclosed by a seven-foot-tall fence of wrought iron. In the southwest corner stands a mausoleum.

If the beacon has not been lit (see areas Q16 and Q53), read the following text when the characters cross the cemetery for the first time:

>You suddenly feel like someone or something is watching you. Looking up, you spot a well-dressed man with a thick mane of thistledown hair observing you from a high tower window. He draws the curtain and disappears from view.

The strange man watches the characters through the southwest window of the War Room. He is merely an apparition intended to lure the characters to that room.

The mausoleum in the southwest is [[The Silver Mausoleum]]

The thick fog obscures the fact that five of the graves have been dug up. Closer inspection and a successful **DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check** reveals that the corpses buried there crawled out of the earth. Of the missing corpses there is no sign, but the surrounding fence is intact, which suggests that no one got into the cemetery from outside. (These corpses were animated by the spirits of revenants and clawed their way out.)

A stone staircase curls up the outside of a turret to a flagstone landing in front of a sturdy wooden door. The door is barred from the inside and opens into the Knight's Chapel.
