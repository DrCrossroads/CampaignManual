## **Argynvost Citadel Overview**

The ruined fortress-mansion of [[_The Silver Order]], perched on the edge of **Argynvost Crest**, is a solemn monument to a failed crusade. Its once-majestic halls are now draped in eerie silence, inhabited only by restless spirits, the echoes of old battles, and the lingering presence of **Vladimir Horngaard**, the misguided **Lich of the Silver Order**.

The **cemetery** behind the citadel, choked with mist and forgotten gravestones, holds the **Silver Mausoleum**, an entrance to the sprawling **catacombs beneath the city**.

Despite its ruin, there are still hidden **relics of the Order**, spectral **knights bound to their oaths**, and traces of **Argynvost’s ancient power** scattered within.

### **Key NPCs**

- **[[Vladimir Horngaard]] (CR 8 Lich)** – Once the stalwart leader of the Silver Order, Vladimir is now a **half-mad, oathbound lich**. He seeks to **prevent Strahd’s destruction**, believing it will unshackle the **Elder God** entirely. He still wields considerable necromantic power, but his body is deteriorating due to his incomplete transformation.
- **Sir [[Godfrey Gwilym]] (Revenant, CR 8)** - A commanding officer who is stern but has a sense of honor and fairness. He is not without mercy, as even after being attacked unprovoked, he was still willing to negotiate with his attacker's allies and broker peace.
- **Sir Cedric Marrowind (Spectral Knight, CR 6)** – One of the last spirits still bound to duty, Cedric wavers between loyalty to Vladimir and an urge to free himself. He may aid the players if they prove their worth.
- **Lady Evelyn Harrow (Ghost, CR 5)** – The former Keeper of Records for the Silver Order, Evelyn’s spirit lingers in the **library**, her knowledge trapped in the echoes of her death.
- **The Faceless Inquisitor (Revenant, CR 7)** – A vengeful knight who **hunts oathbreakers and betrayers**. If the players meddle too much in the citadel, they may rouse this terrifying spirit.
