# Catacombs Beneath the City
Connected to [[The Silver Mausoleum]]

- **Location**: An ancient network of underground tunnels and crypts built before the city was founded. They were once used for burials, but after the population grew, they were sealed off and forgotten. In recent years, however, strange disappearances have been linked to these dark passages.
- **Hauntings**: The catacombs are filled with the remains of the dead, their faces twisted in eternal agony. The tunnels are narrow and winding, and there’s a constant, suffocating feeling of being watched. Those who venture too deep into the catacombs often report hearing whispers, cries, and the sound of footsteps following them. The restless souls trapped here yearn to be released, but disturbing the dead may lead to even worse things emerging.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: Someone has been using the catacombs for ritualistic purposes, attempting to summon an ancient evil buried deep within the tunnels. The souls here are not just angry—they’re desperate for release, and they’ll stop at nothing to find someone to help them escape.

## Nursery Rhyme
Deep below, the cold winds blow,
Through halls of bone white as snow.
Step too soft, step too light,
You’ll never again see the light.

Through winding halls and buried stone,
A thousand souls lie alone.
Their voices whisper, soft and low,
"Come walk with us, where none may go."

Deep below where the lost ones sleep,
Footsteps echo, voices weep.
Bones lie waiting, stacked so high,
Do not wake them as you pass by.
For if they stir, if they rise,
You'll be the next with hollow eyes.

Deep below, the cold winds wail,
Whispers rise from coffin’s jail.
Footsteps echo, but you’re alone—
Or are you, in the halls of stone?

## **GENERAL ATMOSPHERE:**

- **Narrow, suffocating tunnels**—the deeper one goes, the more oppressive the air becomes.
- The **stone walls are covered in faded carvings**, depicting rituals of the long-dead civilization that built them.

- **Candlelight and torches flicker violently**, as if reacting to something unseen moving through the tunnels.

### **3. The Winding Tunnels**

- The **altar is cracked and bleeding**, though the **blood vanishes when closely examined**.
- **Paranormal Investigation:**

- **Encounter:**
    - **The Undying Priest**—a skeletal figure in **tattered ceremonial robes** kneels before the altar.

        - **"Restore my bindings, and be forever cursed by the ones who want me free."**
        - **"Release me, and I shall grant you knowledge... but I will walk free once more."**

## **PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION MECHANICS**

### **1. Shifting Reality & Perception**

- Time **moves differently**—party members experience **events out of sync**.
- The **same message may be found in multiple places**, written **in different handwriting**, as if left by multiple people across time.

### **2. Ghostly Echoes**

- **Strong emotional events from the past replay**, sometimes pulling the party into **visions**.
- These visions may include:
    - **The last survivors of the cult’s original rituals, screaming as they are sacrificed.**
    - **The past attempts to seal away the entity, with the players seeing themselves among the wardens.**

### **3. The Final Decision & Consequences**

- The party can **choose to reseal the being**—but doing so will **anger whatever cult still exists**.
- If they **release it**, it may offer **knowledge or power**, but **Barovia City will feel its presence once more**.
- If they **fail to make a choice**, the tunnels **collapse, leaving only darkness... and whispers.**
