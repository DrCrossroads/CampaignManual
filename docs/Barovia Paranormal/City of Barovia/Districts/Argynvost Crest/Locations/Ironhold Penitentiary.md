# The Abandoned Prison

- **Location**: A long-abandoned prison, its gates rusted and its cells empty, standing on a desolate plot of land far from the city. The penitentiary was closed after a violent riot in the 1910s, which led to the deaths of dozens of inmates and guards.
- **Hauntings**: The prison is filled with the restless spirits of the prisoners, their tormented wails echoing through the broken bars. Cell doors sometimes slam shut on their own, and there’s an unnatural chill in the air. Some say the riot was fueled by something darker than prison conditions—perhaps a malevolent force that manipulated the prisoners to their deaths.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: Investigating the events leading up to the riot might uncover the involvement of a mysterious cult that was operating within the prison, performing occult rituals in the name of a dark god. Their influence may still linger in the prison, waiting for new blood to awaken the power.

## Nursery Rhyme
Iron bars and rusted chains,
Echoed cries and endless pains.
Once they begged, once they bled,
Now they whisper from the dead.

Rattle, rattle, iron chains,
Slam the door and shout their names.
But the guards have left, the warden’s fled,
And all who stayed are now the dead.

Walls remember, doors still weep,
Cells still hold what should not creep.
A prison locked, a debt unpaid,
Step inside—your price is laid.

Steel bars rattle, chains will scrape,
No prisoner here has yet escaped.
Echoed cries and shadowed feet,
The jailers gone, yet none are free.

Rust on the bars, dust in the air,
Footsteps echo—but no one's there.
The warden's gone, the guards are too,
Yet someone is still watching you.

## **General Atmosphere:**

- A looming, skeletal structure of rusted bars, collapsed cell blocks, and crumbling stone.
- Faint whispers drift through the halls, sometimes forming fragmented, chilling sentences.
- Graffiti-like scrawlings of **occult sigils** remain on the walls, some glowing faintly under the right conditions.
- At night, phantom torchlight flickers in the halls, as if the riot is about to begin again.

## **Areas of the Prison:**

### **1. The Outer Courtyard**

- Overgrown with weeds, the prison yard is eerily silent.
- The gallows still stand, though they creak even when there is no wind.
- Investigating the **hanging ropes** may reveal spectral echoes of past executions.
- **Encounter:** A **phantom executioner** attempting to "finish the job" by dragging the living onto the gallows.

### **2. The Cell Blocks**

- Rows of empty cells, but the doors sometimes slam shut on their own.
- Faint figures can be seen curled in the corners of some cells, whispering incoherently.
- **Paranormal Investigation Mechanic:**
    - **Spirit Triggers**: Certain objects (like a diary, old playing cards, or a prisoner’s nameplate) can **summon** fragmented memories or ghosts.
    - **Residual Energy**: Players who stay too long in the block must make a **Wisdom save** or begin to hear the voices of the dead, influencing their thoughts.
- **Encounter:** A **ghastly inmate**, a former cultist whose soul is bound to his cell, will attack those who try to take his remains.

### **3. The Warden’s Office**

- A shattered desk, a chair that **rocks on its own**, and a filing cabinet that still has some records.
- **Investigation**:
    - Players may find records of **inmate transfers**, many of whom were never released.
    - **An unsigned letter** warns of "The Ritual" performed before the riot.
- **Encounter:** The **ghost of the warden**, still trapped by guilt, may try to possess a party member to "restore order."

### **4. The Isolation Wing**

- The **worst** prisoners were kept here, but there are **symbols scratched into the walls** that resemble cult markings.
- Players may experience **visionary hallucinations** of past inmates suffering.
- A cell remains **locked with a strange sigil**, requiring an arcane solution or brute force.
- **Encounter:** A **wraith of a former cult leader**, who still whispers secrets of the Elder God to those who listen.

### **5. The Boiler Room / Ritual Chamber**

- This is where the **prison cult** performed their last ritual, which is believed to have triggered the riot.
- The walls are scorched, but a **circle of charred bones** remains.
- **Dark Presence:**
    - Players who step into the room may feel **their own rage boiling**, requiring a Wisdom save to avoid aggression.
    - **Investigating the sigils** may provide insight into the Elder God’s nature—but could also mark them for later corruption.
- **Encounter:**
    - A **shadow entity** (possibly tied to the Elder God) manifests here if the wrong ritual is performed or if **too much noise is made** in the prison.

## **Paranormal Investigation Mechanics**

- **Temperature Drops:** The deeper players go, the colder it gets. A sudden **freezing chill** may indicate an entity’s presence.
- **Spirit Echoes:** Using investigation tools (like audio devices, mirrors, or divination magic), players might hear or **see flashbacks** of the past.
- **Ritual Sensitivity:** Certain areas react **strongly** to magic—casting **divination or necromancy** may cause **spontaneous hauntings** or open rifts to the past.
- **Possession Hazard:**
    - Players who interact too much with the prison’s history (reading too many notes, engaging too much with spirits) may suffer from **mild possession**, which influences their behavior.
    - A possessed player might unconsciously **repeat old prisoner numbers**, feel the urge to attack others, or even try to complete the cult’s ritual.

---

## **Plot Hooks for the Party**

- **A missing investigator** was last seen heading to Ironhold to prove ghosts exist. Their notes might still be inside.
- **A cursed artifact** from the prison is causing hauntings in the city, and the party must return it.
- **One of the prisoners' souls is still tied to an unfinished crime**—perhaps they were innocent, and the truth is hidden somewhere inside.
- **The cult’s ritual is incomplete**, and the prison is a ticking time bomb of eldritch energy. If the party doesn’t investigate, something worse may awaken.
