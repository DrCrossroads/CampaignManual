# The Vanishing Inn

- **Location**: A remote inn located at the edge of a long-forgotten road, once a popular stop for travelers. However, those who have tried to return to the inn after visiting find that it has mysteriously disappeared, as if swallowed by the earth itself.
- **Hauntings**: The inn is said to be a place where time and space do not behave normally. Guests who stayed there describe strange happenings: rooms that appear to shift, doors that open into different rooms, and eerie lights that flicker from within. Some guests claim that they were visited by figures from their past, or by spectral inhabitants who demand payment for their stay, despite the fact that they were never charged.
- **Possible Plot Hook**: The inn was built on an ancient site tied to an otherworldly presence. The land itself is cursed, and the inn acts as a waystation for the lost souls who find themselves trapped in an endless loop. Investigating the inn may reveal that time itself has been twisted by a terrible pact made by the inn’s original owner.

## Nursery Rhyme
Stay a night at Wayfarer’s Rest,
A warm bed, a welcome guest.
The clocks may tick, the night may fall,
But come the dawn—you’re lost to all.

Check in once, check in twice,
The keeper’s smile is awfully nice.
But nights stretch long, the clocks don’t chime,
And you are lost outside of time.

Welcome, traveler, come inside,
A place to rest, a place to hide.
The clocks may turn, the candles burn,
But time here bends and twists in turn.
Stay a while, enjoy your bed,
Just know you may wake up dead.

One night’s stay, one night’s rest,
Time may twist at Wayfarer’s Nest.
Morning comes, or so you think,
Step outside—your life’s a blink.

## **General Atmosphere:**

- The **inn seems normal** at first, though aged and dust-covered, as if abandoned for decades.
- Time is **fluid**—watches stop working, the sun and moon do not behave normally.
- Guests find **rooms shifting**, staircases looping back to where they started, and doors leading to places they shouldn’t.
- At times, visitors see **reflections of themselves behaving strangely** in mirrors or windows, as if caught in different moments in time.
- **The most terrifying realization**—there is no way out. Stepping outside the inn’s doors **only brings them back inside** from another entrance.

---

## **Key Areas of the Inn:**

### **1. The Lobby & Check-In Desk**

- A **guest ledger** remains open, listing names that **change when not being observed**.
- A bell sits on the front desk, but if rung, it produces a **hollow, distorted echo**.
- **Investigation:** Searching the desk reveals **keychains without keys**, or receipts from **dates that have not yet occurred**.
- **Encounter:** A **polite but uncanny spectral innkeeper** greets visitors but never answers direct questions about time or location.

---

### **2. The Parlor & Common Room**

- Faint music plays from an **old gramophone**, but the record is spinning **without a needle**.
- **Seating arrangements** subtly change when not observed, and **portraits on the wall shift expressions** when glanced at.
- **Paranormal Trigger:** If guests attempt to warm themselves by the fire, **it suddenly goes cold**, and whispers emerge from the ashes.
- **Encounter:** A **ghostly patron** sits near the fireplace, only visible in reflections. If confronted, they **reveal a past event that never happened**—or worse, something from the **player’s own future**.

---

### **3. The Dining Hall**

- A grand **banquet table is set**, but covered in thick dust.
- The **food appears fresh at first**, but spoils into rot if eaten.
- **Paranormal Investigation:** Writing appears on the tablecloth, only visible in **candlelight**—entries from past guests warning others **not to stay the night**.
- **Encounter:** A **waiter without a face** moves about, stopping before each guest as if expecting an order. If ignored too long, they whisper, **“It is already served.”** and **something shifts in reality**.

---

### **4. The Guest Rooms**

- Rooms **never stay in the same place**; guests opening their door may find themselves stepping into a hallway, another room, or even **a moment from their past**.
- **Paranormal Effect:**
    - If a guest looks under the bed, they see **themselves sleeping there**—and wake up moments later in the bed, as if time reversed.
    - **Mirrors do not reflect the present**; instead, they show past or future moments within the inn.
- **Encounter:** A **ghostly traveler** is found **locked inside their own room**, desperate to escape. But when the door is opened—**the room is empty.**

---

### **5. The Hallways & Staircases**

- **Looping pathways**—walking forward leads travelers back to where they started.
- **Doors open into past versions of themselves**, sometimes showing the inn during its construction, or even as a burned-out husk.
- **Paranormal Triggers:**
    - Knocking on a door **summons a knock from behind the guests**, even when no one is there.
    - Looking too long down the hallway may reveal **a shadowy figure watching**—but upon blinking, the figure is now much closer.
- **Encounter:** **Echoes of past guests** flicker in and out of reality, murmuring about their fate before fading.

---

### **6. The Owner’s Private Quarters** (Locked)

- **Investigation:** Searching the office reveals:
    - **A map of the region**, but the inn’s location has been circled **with the note: "It was never here."**
    - A **ledger with guest names that include the players' names**, written before they ever arrived.
    - A **diary entry** describing how the inn’s owner made a **bargain with an otherworldly force** to make his inn **"a place outside of time."**
- **Encounter:** If the players linger too long, **the owner himself appears**, but **his form distorts**—he is no longer human, but **something stretched and wrong**.

---

### **7. The Basement / Forbidden Cellar**

- The stairs down are **longer than they should be**, as if descending endlessly.
- The air is thick with the **stench of decay**, and **distant knocking** can be heard.
- **Paranormal Investigation:**
    - The **walls have claw marks** as if people tried to escape.
    - A **massive, runic sigil** is carved into the floor—a **binding spell** that seems broken.
    - The farther the players go, **the older they feel**, their bodies aching as if time is catching up to them.
- **Final Encounter:** A **time-bound entity**, **The Forgotten Guest**, has been **trapped for centuries**. If released, it may offer forbidden knowledge—or **undo reality itself**.

## **Paranormal Investigation Mechanics**

1. **Distortions in Time & Memory**
    
    - Players may **momentarily see themselves from earlier in the session**.
    - Objects they pick up may have **their own future selves etched into them**.
    - **Memories may change**—players may "remember" a past stay at the inn, even if they've never been here before.
2. **Mirrors & Reflection Hazards**
    
    - Looking too long into mirrors may reveal **different versions of the party**—some **wounded, missing, or already dead**.
    - **Breaking a mirror** may **trap a player in a loop**, forcing them to relive the last few minutes until they correct their actions.
3. **The Midnight Bell**
    
    - **At midnight, a bell tolls, regardless of the timekeeping devices in the party’s possession.**
    - **Each toll marks the inn becoming more unstable**—ghostly figures manifest more frequently, and the walls begin **closing in**.
    - If the bell tolls **twelve times**, the party may become permanently trapped.
4. **The Way Out (If There Is One)**
    
    - Players **must unravel the inn’s secret**—whether by:
        - **Breaking the original bargain** of the innkeeper.
        - **Sealing the rift in the basement** before it consumes them.
        - **Accepting the inn’s fate** and "checking out" in a ritual.
    - If they fail, **they will wake up at the check-in desk, as if they never arrived.**
