## Descriptions
### _(The Haunted Ward, The Prison of the Lost)_

Perched atop a crumbling hill, **Argynvost Crest** is a district **trapped between life and death.** This once-majestic neighborhood has become a graveyard of its own history, with **fog-drenched streets** filled with **silent, ruined mansions and shuttered manors.**

At the heart of the district stands **Argynvost Penitentiary**, the **city’s most infamous prison**, where only the worst criminals were sent—though many claim **it held more than just criminals**. The prison is still there, **abandoned**, yet some say the cells are **not empty.**

- **Notable Locations:**
    - **Argynvost Penitentiary** – An **abandoned prison**, rumored to still hold **the spirits of its inmates**—and something worse.
    - **The Silver Mausoleum** – A vast, underground crypt where **forgotten nobles** were laid to rest, though **some say they have begun to stir.**
    - **The Fog Lantern** – A nautical speakeasy **where only ghosts are welcome**—yet mortals sometimes find themselves **trapped within its walls.**
- **Atmosphere:**
    - A **constant sense of unease,** as if someone (or something) is always **watching.**
    - **Occasional whispers on the wind**, speaking in **forgotten tongues.**
    - A **perpetual chill**, even in the heat of summer, and lanterns that **flicker without cause.**
