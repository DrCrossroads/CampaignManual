- **Type**: Ghosts / Apparition
- **Appearance**: A large group of phantasmal figures, originally a choir, whose bodies are rotting and decayed, but their mouths move in unison, singing a haunting song. Their voices distort, sending vibrations of despair throughout the area.
- **Background**: A choir that once performed for the elite, who were all killed during a botched ritual. Their souls were twisted by an unknowable force and now wander the city, performing their eerie song, drawing anyone who hears it into an abyssal nightmare.
- **Abilities**: Hearing their song for too long can cause individuals to experience vivid hallucinations and drive them to self-harm or madness. The choir can also briefly manifest in physical form, attacking anyone who tries to stop their song.
- **Twist**: The song may be a key to an eldritch being’s return, and stopping the choir requires deciphering the meaning of their performance.

**Horrific Harmony**: The Corrupted Choir can harmonize to cause madness. All creatures within 60 feet that can hear the choir must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute.
