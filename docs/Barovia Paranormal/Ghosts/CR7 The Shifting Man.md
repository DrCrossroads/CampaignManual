- **Type**: Phantom / Possessed Human
- **Appearance**: A shadowy figure with an unnatural number of limbs, dressed in a 1920s suit, constantly shifting in and out of existence. His face, when seen, is a twisted mask of sorrow and anger.
- **Background**: A man who became obsessed with immortality and made a pact with something inhuman. Now his form is unstable, shifting between dimensions and occasionally possessing the living. He appears to people near the edges of madness and whispers promises of power or revenge.
- **Abilities**: The Shifting Man can possess NPCs, causing them to act erratically and sometimes violently. He also warps reality in his presence, creating areas of disorienting geometry.
- **Twist**: To put an end to his reign of terror, the players may need to find the ritual that holds his essence in this reality and confront the horror he bargained with.

**Shifting Form**: The Shifting Man can use his action to briefly alter his shape, causing his body to elongate, split, or twist unnaturally. This grants him advantage on Stealth checks and makes his attacks count as magical for the next 1 minute.

**Dimensional Jolt**: As a reaction, when the Shifting Man takes damage, he can shift momentarily into a different plane. He becomes immune to the damage and reappears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet.

**Unstable Appearance**: Any creature that directly sees the Shifting Man must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll as they are momentarily entranced by his form.
