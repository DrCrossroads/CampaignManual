- **Type**: Aberration / Phantom Creature
- **Appearance**: A large, misshapen mass of flesh, scales, and tentacles. It has a vaguely humanoid form, but its body is constantly shifting, with strange appendages sprouting and fading. Its skin is mottled, with patches of decay.
- **Background**: A manifestation of an ancient sea god or entity, drawn from the ocean depths, it exists as a nightmare made flesh. The creature is an omen of a forgotten cult, feeding on those who wander Murder Manor.
