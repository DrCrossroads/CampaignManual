- **Type**: Haunting / Vengeful Spirit
- **Appearance**: A man in a 1920s press uniform with a perfectly smooth, featureless face. His body radiates an oppressive aura, and his hands hold a typewriter with blood-stained keys.
- **Background**: A journalist who uncovered the corruption of the city's elite but was killed by mysterious figures to silence him. His spirit now roams the city, forcing people to relive his final moments in nightmarish visions.
- **Abilities**: The Faceless Journalist can force anyone to read articles he writes on his typewriter, each one detailing their death in excruciating detail. The more a person reads, the closer they get to their own demise.
- **Twist**: The players may need to uncover the identity of his killers or the twisted conspiracy he was writing about, or they will slowly lose their grip on sanity.
